# genesis-web
This repository holds the various files and source code related to the Basingstoke Genesis science fiction club.

## Hosting
The web site is nominally hosted at https://genesis-sf.org.uk.

## Branches
Historically, the web site was designed by Antony Walls, then later modified by Matthew Greet. A current snapshot of that
original site will be stored in a separate branch called `orig`. Changes can be made there for inclusion in the web page
until the revamping is completed.

In the meantime, a `jekyll` branch will be used to hold changes related to the revamping of the web site. This will be done
using the static web site generate Jekyll. No specific time frame for this has been set, but it's where we'd like to go
moving forward. When the `jekyll` branch gets to a stable point, it will be applied to the `main` branch, and the hosted
web site will be updated to follow.

If you wish to contribute, please create your own personal branch off the appropriate `orig` or `jekyll` or `main` branches.
You will then need to generate a Pull Request and get approval before merging into one of those other branches.
