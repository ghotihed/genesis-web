		<P>The initial idea of Genesis, as the name suggests, was a new
		  beginning. Now it is just to provide a place for like-minded fans to gather and
		  talk all things Science Fiction. <BR><BR>The main aim of
		  <A CLASS="inline" HREF="aboutUs.shtml">Genesis</A> is to hold group meetings in a
		  friendly atmosphere where you can talk SF, to watch and discuss movies and
		  television series, eat good food, and participate in a variety of quizzes run
		  by our members, to play games and participate in discussions. We also organise
		  events external to the Public Meetings, such as trips to the cinema, ten pin
		  bowling, paintballing and conventions. <BR><BR>We are not tied down to only one
		  format, such as Star Trek or Star Wars, as we believe that anybody who is
		  interested in SF has a wider horizon of interests. We also do not believe in,
		  and do not have any kind of rank or points system nor exams.</P>
