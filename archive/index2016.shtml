        <P>So, things are a little up in the air these days.  It&#39;s not a <i>complete</i> surprise that the White Hart weren&#39;t interested in letting us meet there anymore, what with the change of owners and all, but it would have been nice if they&#39;d at least talked to us about it...Never mind, we&#39;ll come up with something.  Probably even better - like have food available!!<br />
        <br />
        Sadly, it&#39;s almost certainly going to cost more but we&#39;ve been paying so little for the last few years we have to expect that.<br />
        <br />
        Since this meeting is going to be...well...a real meeting, with real issues to discuss, we will be having a very flexible People&#39;s Choice sort of program to watch as we have time.  This courtesy of Paul with is kind (lazy&#63;) enough to work around us.<br />
        <br />
        Aside from needing to choose our future meeting place, Games Day is almost here!!  Well, not as almost as the original date of the 20<sup>th</sup> - Firestorm Cards, who has kindly agreed to serve as a venue, had a conflict so it will now be held on the 27<sup>th</sup> of February (in 2 weeks!)  It&#39;s a nice place, with lots of room for different kinds of games, and a kitchen for snacks.  Just like last time, the cost is &pound;2 OR a food donation (cakes or biscuits are particularly good choices!).  Bring your favourite game and have a great time!<br />

        <P>It&#39;s June&#33;  Summer at last, not that you can tell at the moment.  A big thanks to Tony for arranging last month&#39;s program on short notice &mdash; and an interesting program it was&#33;  Not a bad way of doing things&#59; I liked being able to pick from a short list to fit my mood.<br/>
        <br/>
        Paul is doing the program this month, and I&#39;d love to say something properly pithy or even, dare I say,. amusing about it...but I have absolutely no idea what he has planned, so everyone will just have to provide their commentary.<br/>
        <br/>
        I don&#39;t have much else to say except that I&#39;ve had a gruelling week (or two.  Or was that three&#63;) and so am skiving off this month and leaving things in the capable hands of my other half; if anyone has any concerns, comments or (better yet) praise for anything pass it along&#33;<br/>
