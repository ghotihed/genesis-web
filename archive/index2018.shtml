        <P>Seasons Greetings.</P>
        <P>This month is the AGM, where you get to decide the course of the next year for the club. If you are interested in being more active in the club organization, we'd be happy to have you! We'd also love any and all suggestions for future events, field trips, or activities for the coming year.</P>

        <P>Hi Everybody!! It's time for another exciting episode of the Genesis Monthly Meeting!! Last month was an exciting collection of new shows courtesy of Paul. I especially liked Wellington Paranormal--perhaps I should be embarrassed by that.</P>
        <P>This month is being planned by Tony, and I'm sure it will be wonderful as always, although there will be some bl--dy cartoons; fair warning, Paul!</P>
        <P>I have to add my usual plea that if anyone has any ideas about activities for the club don't keep it to yourself!</P>
        <P>Also, we are running short of raffle prizes--if you find a bargain or something cool in the back of the closet, think of Genesis!</P>
        <P>Your chair,<BR>René</P>

        <P><---yawn---> Craig says that I really need to do this Gold Channel, but I can hardly keep my eyes open so please forgive my rambling.</P>
        <P>Last month-and-a-bit's program was kindly provided by Tony, and a nice program it was, too. I didn't watch the movie very closely, but what I saw was intriguing and I think I'll make a point of watching it properly. Thanks, Tony!</P>
        <P>This month is courtesy of Jacob, and he spent much time and effort getting it together. His theme (yes, he even has a theme!!) is 'crashes'. Well done Jacob! And I promise I won't get inside knowledge of the quiz...or at least not too much. Honest.</P>
        <P>Amazing as it is, it's time to arrange the Christmas meal. This year, it's going to be at the Red Lion again and will be on our regular Genesis day, if possible. I'll get the prices and put out a sign up sheet/menu selection, and Matt will collect the payment. The Council provides the December program, so we'll try to get you something good!</P>
