      <UL> 
        <LI>The site priorities are:- 
          <DL> 
            <DT>High</DT> 
            <DD>Marketing, club news.</DD> 
            <DT>Medium</DT> 
            <DD>Repository of member's work.</DD> 
            <DT>Low</DT> 
            <DD>News of upcoming sci fi events, review of events, DVDs
              etc.</DD> 
          </DL></LI> 
        <LI>Assume a page size of 800 by 600 pixes.</LI> 
        <LI>Assume Javascript is enabled.</LI> 
        <LI>The site should emphasise original work, including photographs, by
          club members or guests over links or references, which has a higher emphasis
          over archive material. Large amounts of text cannot be copied elsewhere from
          the web. This ensures the site appears to have inherent value, rather than be a
          derivative.</LI> 
        <LI>The site must have the tone of an active club. This can be achieved
          with fresh events attended by the club, photographs, articles and reviews.</LI>
        
        <LI>Out of date material, including news, is moved into an archive,
          which can still be viewed.</LI> 
        <LI>The menu should only have one or two layers for ease of navigation,
          except for accessing archive material.</LI> 
        <LI>Pages that are collections, rather than a single document, should
          hide most of the item in a short box that can be expanded to display the whole
          item. Such boxes use an icon and a subtitle to indicate it's contents. This
          avoids excessively bland walls of text that can't be scanned quickly.</LI> 
        <LI>Everything, especially photographs, should brief description to
          establish context unless it's self explanatory.</LI> 
      </UL> 
      <H2 CLASS="subtitle">Gallery</H2> 
      <UL> 
        <LI>1/2 of pictures on a gallery must include a person. This shows the
          club as a social club.</LI> 
        <LI>Pictures are grouped by event and date and use short boxes that are
          dated and sorted into descending date order.</LI> 
        <LI>Each picture group has a brief description to provide context.</LI>
        
        <LI>Pictures are archived after 3 years.</LI>

        <LI>Articles must be written by a member or guest of the club.</LI> 
        <LI>Articles must appear in The Universe Today first, unless rejected
          by its editor.</LI> 
        <LI>Articles are never archived except for The Universe Today, which is
          archived after 1 year.</LI>

        <LI>Items are restricted to UK events and releases.</LI> 
        <LI>Items are merely what's noticed by the webmaster and club members
          and not meant to be a complete list.</LI> 
        <LI>Items use short boxes that are sorted into descending date order
          for released or ascending for schedule date.</LI> 
        <LI>Items have a brief description, which can include ratings.</LI> 
        <LI>For recurring events, only the next one is shown.</LI> 
        <LI>Events are removed when they are over, though the next iteration
          can be displayed.</LI> 
        <LI>Cinema releases are archived 1 month after their release date.</LI>
        
        <LI>A TV series is divided into separate, confirmed seasons, all of
          which are displayed. Unconfirmed seasons aren't considered.</LI> 
        <LI>TV seasons are archived when they are over, which can still leave

        <LI>Event reviews are only kept for 5 years or 2 if the event appears
          to have no next iteration.</LI> 
        <LI>Cinema reviews are not archived as they can still appear on TV or
          DVD.</LI> 
        <LI>TV reviews are not archived as they can be repeated or appear on
          DVD.</LI> 
        <LI>DVD/audio reviews are not archived as they're always traded.</LI>

        <LI>Friends need not be sci fi or cult related but at least 2/3 must be
          sci fi or be liked by typical sci fi fans. This keeps the page relevant to sci
          fi interests.</LI> 
        <LI>Articles use short boxes that are sorted into alphabetical
