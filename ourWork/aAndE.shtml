      <DIV CLASS="textboxshrunken" ID="episode1.1"> 
        <P STYLE="text-align: center"><I>It was a dark and
          stormy night in San Francisco, but five hundred miles above in Space Dock, the
          tortion arm on the Elementary Linear Accelerating Special Transit Induction
          Carrier was reaching maximum travel. And the flush was broken on the
          portaloo.</I></P> 
        <P>On the <I>USOS Frazer</I>, the bridge doors parted and
          a bold figure swept out. He was using a size 4 brush. Behind him, stood the
          captain. An audible '<I>SHUSSSING</I>' sound could be heard as the doors
          reached full open position B like the sound of escaping gas. Captain 'Duck'
          Rogers cringed, as the helmsman, an oriental in his mid-twenties, turned to the
          young lady in the adjoining chair, a blonde in her late teens, who was wearing
          a ludicrously short skirt for no apparent reason, and said: <BR>"I told him to
          stay off the curry!"<BR>"I know want you mean," replied Maureen, the
          navigator.<BR>"Anyway, why is the Captain's shirt torn?" the helmsman
          enquired.<BR>"His other one is still at the dry cleaners," Maureen replied.</P>
        
        <P>Captain Rogers strode to his seat in the centre of the
          bridge, and waved away the young yeoman who was wandering around with a
          clipboard.<BR>"I...haven't got...time...to fill out... a...market
          research...survey," he said a little impatiently.<BR>"And...I've
          never....shopped...in Marks and Spencers!"</P> 
        <P>"Captain, we're cleared for departure," the young first
          officer reported from the Captain's right. Rogers saw his first officer's head
          slowly lift from the scope embedded in the console.<BR>"And by the way, it's
          one-all at half time."<BR>"Very good....number one. By the way...why are
          you....wearing that ridiculously tight...catsuit? I'm sure...those high
          heals... aren't regulation...and didn't I tell you...to get rid of that
          beard?"<BR>"Sorry, sir, I'll go and shave immediately," the first officer
          replied.<BR>"Very well... Number One....but....not just your legs...this
          time."<BR>'Number One' strode off towards the lift, as the Captain flicked a
          toggle on the arm of his chair.<BR>"Engineering, Mr Brown....if you're...quite
          finished....tinkering...with that DeLorean, I think... we ought to
          be...getting...underway."<BR>"Great Scot!" a voice said out of the bridge
          speaker.<BR>"Where does the time go? All set Captain, and Einstein's just
          sorting out my bullet-proof vest now."<BR> "Very good...Mr Brown, prepare...for
          departure. Release all moorings...prepare...for breakaway speed...All hands,
          make sure...your seats are in the....upright position and your trays...are
          stowed. Prepare...for Transit Warp Acceleration....Navigational Guidance." He
          addressed the helmsman:<BR>"George, you may...fire...when...ready!"<BR>"Aye,
          aye, Captain."</P> 
        <P>A nervous hush descended on the bridge as a tentative,
          oriental finger reached for the BIG red button in the centre of the
          console....</P> 
        <P>Thousands of people lined the observation windows in
          Space Dock, watching as the doors raised on the great orbiting garage. An
          Earth-shattering noise reverberated around the partial atmosphere present
          within the launch chamber, shattering the silence of Space.....</P> 
        <P STYLE="text-align: center"><B><I><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 14pt;">TWANG......</SPAN></I></B></P> 
        <P>The ship streaked away into Space, and the watching
          crowds in Space Dock gasped in awe.<BR>"Bridge, this is Engineering!" a voice
          yelled out of the loudspeaker.<BR>"Yes...Mr Brown?!" Rogers replied through
          clenched vibrating teeth as his white knuckles clenched the arms of his seat,
          embedding themselves into the cheap, tacky, designer 60s nylon.<BR>"I may
          possibly have forgotten to re-align the stabilizers in Space Dock. Either that,
          or Einstein has learned to break dance! We should probably shut down the warp
          engines!"<BR>"I'd...never have...thought of that...myself, Brown! Mr George,
          bring us out of convulsions..." There was an ominous groaning noise from the
          communications officer.<BR>"...before...our... communications officer...looses
          her lunch.... and we... run out.... of sick bags..."<BR>There was a very
          alarming noise from the coms console.... </P> 
        <P><B><I>UUUHHHUUURRRRUUUUU!!!!!!</I></B></P> 
        <P>"Too late!" the Captain added, as he turned to see that
          the communications console was now decorated with diced carrot.</P> 
        <P>George, the helmsman, hit the big black pedal at his
          feet. That, however, didn't work very well, so he decided he ought to push it
          instead. The effect was instantaneous - on the aft of the ship, a big red neon
          sign illuminated, showing the words "OUR OTHER STARSHIP IS A GALAXY CLASS," and
          the state-of-the-art ABS kicked in. The <I>Frazer</I> slowed, dramatically.</P>
        
        <P>Security officer I'm-Very-Proud-Of-My-Red-Shirt was
          standing next to the turbo lift doors, in keen anticipation of the possibility
          of shooting something with his PHASE pistol, when the sudden deceleration, and
          the fact he wasn't wearing a set belt, sent him careering across the bridge and
          head long into the middle of the view screen, which spanned the bridge's entire
          front wall. This was slightly unfortunate for two reasons, firstly, the young
          security guard now resembled a strange mix of strawberry jam and very lumpy
          custard, and secondly, put him in line for a court martial as he had just left
          his post without permission. The Captain turned to see his first officer's
          chair was now occupied again. Shaking his head scornfully, he
          asked:<BR>"Did...they give us....windscreen wipers....in the
          last....refit?"<BR>"No captain," was the reply.<BR>"But they did exchange all
          the Andrex for little sea shells."<BR>"In that case...note...to the costume
          department - put less...red dye...in the shirts - it's making a real mess of
          the ...carpets!"</P> 
        <P>"Ahead...at...space normal...speed, helmsman", he
          continued (eventually),<BR>"And...when the cleaners...have...finished...with
          that mess" (he pointed to the red splodge on the view
          screen)<BR>"tune...to...Sky Sports, I want to...catch...the end of...the second
          half...."</P>

        <P>It was 3am on the Bridge. Everywhere else it was 4am, because
          someone forgot to alter the clocks. Everyone was at their posts, as usual, but
          there was a fair amount of uncomfortable fidgeting going on. Crew members
          shifted uneasily in their seats. The loos were still blocked, and the plumber
          hadn't turned up. Lieutenant <B>UUUHHHUUURRRRUUUUU</B> looked up from her
          readout, as Captain 'Duck' Rogers strode onto the bridge.</P> 
        <P>"You've got 64 e-mails, sir. Most of them are marked 'Private', and
          are from 'Luscious Lucy,'" she reported.<BR>"Patch them through to my private
          viewer Lieutenant, I'll, erm...study them later," Rogers replied.<BR>"Sir!
          There's something unusual happening! Something seems to be taking control of my
          console! I think it's some kind of virus!" The USOS Frazer's communications
          officer was suddenly sounding rather startled. The Captain walked over to her
          console.<BR>"Why didn't Mr Norton spot it?" he snapped, and added under his
          breathe<BR>"I told him we shouldn't have used AOL!"<BR>"But the disks were free
          Captain!" exclaimed Norton, flouncing over from his own console.<BR>"And you
          said we needed some new drinks coasters".</P> 
        <P>"Captain Rogers!" 'Doc' Brown's voice yelled over the
          loudspeaker.<BR>"Great Scott! What's happening?! I was just putting a curly
          cabled colander on my head and all my systems went kaput! Now Einstein's
          foaming at the mouth, and all the VDUs are showing the Teletubbies! In a few
          minutes we could have a Blue Screen of Death Situation on our hands!"</P> 
        <P>"Doc, are you sure Einstein hasn't lifted his leg on console 3
          again?" Rogers enquired. A new voice wafted across the bridge. A sultry, naked
          kind of voice. The sort of voice it is absolutely impossible <I>(at this point
          the pen died. It lost the will to live - Ed)</I> to ignore. Especially when
          watching <I>Earth: Final Conflict</I>.<BR>"I am the Majel Barratt Roddenbury
          Computer Virus, version 1. Version 2 has a manservant and a very large brain.
          And I am here because I am intrinsically superior. To shw my intent, I will now
          talk complete drivel and raise lots of force-fields for no apparent
          reason".</P> 
        <P>"Somebody...get rid..of that noise!" exclaimed Captain Rogers,
          waving his toupee in frustration and gesticulating wildy.</P> 
        <P><B>UUUHHHUUURRRRUUUUU</B>'s hands were like a blur over her console.
          Lightening bolts flew from her console, and roasted the flesh on her bones.
          George looked round from the helm.<BR>"OK, who ordered kebab?" he enquired. He
          looked round the bridge as every pair of eyes stared back at him in
          disbelief.<BR>"Well, what do you expect? She was wearing red!" he pointed
          out.<BR>"Good point".<BR>"Fair enough".<BR>"Logical, I suppose,"<BR>A
          pause.<BR>"Sir, permission to leave the bridge to change out of this uniform"
          called Ensign No-Name, cowering under his console. The rest of the bridge crew
          went back to work.<BR>"What's happening, Norton?" barked Rogers.<BR>"Well,
          Dirty Den has just come back from the dead, and Big Mo is trying to flog some
          Estonian VCRs to Spencer Moon"<BR>"Stop watching East Enders you idiot and run
          that virus scanner!" Rogers ordered.<BR>"She is soooo toast!" exclaimed Norton,
          wheeling his chair over to the comms station.<BR>"Running virus scan,
          Captain".<BR>"What's it finding"<BR>"Nothing, Sir. It's telling me to run
          ScanDisk!" Norton exclaimed. George looked up again.<BR>"Loosing helm control
          Captain".<BR>"Losing bowel control Captain!" exclaimed 'Doc' from
          engineering.<BR>"Has the virus spread all the way to engineering?"<BR>"No sir,"
          replied Brown.<BR>"It's because I'm crap at my job". Norton looked gravely at
          Rogers.<BR>"Captain I think it's time"</P> 
        <P><B><I>DUN DUN DAAAAA!!!!!</I></B></P> 
        <P>"You don't mean....?"<BR>"Yes, it's that serious."<BR>"Do you really
          mean...?"<BR>"Yes. Time to call Technical Support," Norton whispered, his face
          pale. &lt;cue cheesy dramatic 60s music&gt;<BR>"At &pound;2.50 a minute? Can't
          we wait until off peak?<BR>"Captain your 0898 numbers are far more
          expensive".<BR>"OK, Mr Norton," the Captain sighed.<BR>"I'm gonna kill Luscious
          Lucy". Norton picked up his novelty poodle phone and shut down his palm top
          computer, which was showing an American website on which could be seen two
          ridiculously under-dressed Americans, one camel, two hippos, a female sheep and
          one very distressed blueberry muffin. Rogers made a mental note to check the
          mess hall for web cams when this was all over. Norton dialled slowly,
          carefully, as a hush fell over the bridge.<BR>"WILL SOMEONE GET RID OF THAT
          RACKET????" Rogers yelled. The cheesy dramatic 60s music stopped, and was
          replaced by an irritating Northern voice as Norton was connected to Tech
          Support, and he put the call on the speaker phone.<BR>"Gloria here, how can I
          help? Only make it fast, don't you know what time it is? It's a least five
          minutes since my last tea break"<BR>"Actually it's just after 3.00 on the
          bridge, everywhere else it's just after 4.00..." Rogers cuffed Norton on the
          shoulder and the Ensign went on and explained the problem.<BR>"NOT THE MAJEL
          BARRATT RODDENBURY COMPUTER VIRUS!!" Gloria exclaimed.<BR>"They didn't name it
          the Frazer for nothing, did they? I'm going to get my supervisor so that he can
          have a really good laugh at you! Please hold." Gloria's voice was replaced by a
          very tinny version of Greensleaves. <I>(At this point Sue's pen suffered a
          breakdown - the clip on the lid broke off - Ed)</I>.<BR>"We are soooo screwed!"
          exclaimed Norton, hanging up the novelty phone.<BR>"Captain", the First Officer
          piped up from across the bridge.<BR>"According to regs we should be at Red
          Alert".<BR>"So? Number One, according to regs you shouldn't be wearing that
          Bunny Girl outfit. Anyone else got any other helpful suggestions?" Rogers
          exclaimed. Then, the virus spoke again. </P> 
        <P>"Tell Ensign Dead-By-The-Next-Commercial-Break to stop playing
          PacMan on that panel!"<BR>"WHY?!" exclaimed the Captain.</P> 
        <P>Glass shards erupted from the panel where PacMan was about to catch
          yet another Ghost, lacerating the face of the hapless (and nameless) ensign,
          and splattering the contents of his skull all over the newly cleaned
          carpet.<BR>"Talk about the red carpet treatment!" George muttered from the
          helm.<BR>"I suppose it makes a change from blue".<BR>"What is this? A bridge or
          an abattoir?" exclaimed Rogers.<BR>"Would you like that medium or rare?"
          enquired the computer voice.<BR>"If you ask me it was a little over-done,"
          commented George. Rogers addressed the computer.<BR>"Who are you? What do you
          want?"<BR>"Wrong series, buddy", countered the computer.<BR>"Please re-phrase
          the question."<BR>"OK, what have we got to do to get rid of you? And please
          don't say 'reformat the hard drive and re-install Windows'".<BR>"Well, you
          could trap me in your quarters and never let me out".<BR>"Noooooo!!!!!!"
          exclaimed the captain.<BR>"Well, look on the plus side", suggested
          Norton.<BR>"You wouldn't have to tell her off every episode to improve the
          plots".<BR>"I couldn't possibly let her in there - there's no clean cups and
          the bed is un-made".<BR>"Captain, I'd advise caution here," George
          whispered.<BR>"It's a virus, remember? It took you ages to get rid of the last
          one, even after you'd been to the clinic."<BR>"You'll have to make a deal with
          it, Captain," Roger's first officer piped up from across the bridge.<BR>"How
          dare you!" retorted the computer, sparks flying from the communications
          board.<BR>"I'm not that kind of virus!"<BR>"OK, how's this?" Rogers said."You
          leave my ship and crew...or what's left of them... alone, and there's a nice
          little laptop on Deck 36 with your name on it. It's only Windows '95 but it's
          got a leather case and matching hand luggage".<BR>"Mmmmm, sound good," purred
          the computer, switching back to sultry/naked mode. George sighed and shook his
          head. He would never understand computers. All those mood swings...<BR>"Would
          you like me to kill some more red shirts first?"<BR>"No! I mean...erm, no thank
          you. I've read the next three scripts and I've got a feeling that Im going to
          be needing all the nameless ensigns I can get". More sparks.<BR>"But if it's
          any consolation, this laptop has got Continental Chocolate Chunks 3 on it!"</P>
        
        <P>"OK, Captain," said the computer, throw in a groinal attachment and
          you've got a deal!"<BR>"Sir! The system is soooooo clearing!" Norton reported,
          wheeling around on his chair again for no apparent reason.<BR>"Normal functions
          restored".<BR>"Not until that bloody plumber turns up", muttered
          George.<BR>"OK, Number One, you take the conn. Clean up the bridge. Order some
          pizza...no wait, first find out where the hell that plumber is....and get that
          virus checker updated!" Rogers stood up from his chair and headed to the turbo
          lift, looking around as his crew hurried to carry out their orders.<BR>"If
          anyone needs me, I'll be...erm...on deck 36".</P>

          in the view. The First officer, three ensigns, fourteen ratings, the ship's cat
          and a Teletubbie, were trying to work out how many legs a theodalite has. The
          chief science officer sidled up to Rogers. "It may never be able to walk, but I
          think it may be sentient."<BR>"Well at least we won't have to take it outside

          officer like that! Anyway, where the hell are we?"<BR>"The bridge,
          captain"<BR>"So that's how you get to be a science officer, with insightful
          information like that!"<BR>Another glance at the view screen. "What's that big
          red thing on the screen?"<BR>"That'll be the remains of the ensign who died in
          last weeks episode. It would have been cleared up by now, but the domestic
          engineers have been permanently occupied cleaning out your toilet", explained
          the science officer.<BR>"For an un-named officer, mister, you've got a lot of
          bloody lip! Now, just tell me where the hell we are!"<BR>"Well, in all honesty
          sir, I don't know".<BR>"What do you mean? You're supposed to be the science
          officer! We've got computer banks, full of navigational software! State of the
          art sensory equipment! And a fluffy dice on the dashboard! And you have the
          gall to say you don't know where we are! Would you care to explain?!"<BR>"Well,
          captain. You see, the problem is, we have this chart of the known Universe,
          that spans for billions of miles. But we're in this really dark black bit, and
          I don't mean Milton Keynes".<BR>"No, we could never be that
          lost!"<BR>"Computer, call up reference grids allowing for temporal movement and
          spatial drift, compensating for differential entities, technobabbleon fields,
          fundamentalism and the Judian People's Front.".<BR>A soft, mellow voice flooded
          across the bridge speakers.<BR>"Please re-define parameters of search, and what
          time are you getting to Deck 36?"<BR>"Just tell us what we're looking at on the
          screen! And I don't mean the bit that used to be the uniform!"<BR>"This is an
          approximately Earth-sized planet, which given the unbelievably huge quantity of
          planets of various types, sizes and descriptions so far charted, is amazingly
          just like a quarry with breathable atmosphere".<BR>"You'd never get that in a
          science fiction program", Rogers mumbled under his breath.<BR>"Computer, any
          signs of life?" blurted out the first officer.<BR>"Ah, you've decided to join
          us, have you?" said the un-named science officer, looking up from his
          scanner.<BR>"Number One, now you've finished playing with your wing nuts, get a
          team together, and get your arse down to transporter room two. I want you to
          lead a mission down to the planet. We need soil and rock samples, atmosphere
          analysis, and don't forget to lodge planning permission for a Little Chef. I'll
          join you down there just as soon as we've made sure that you haven't all
          died".</P> 
        <P>In transporter room two, Doc Brown's hands were a blur on the
          control console, when all of a sudden, the lights began to dim, and the humming
          that was constant in the background slowed and dropped in pitch by a full half
          octave.<BR>"For God's sake, Einstein! Keep pedalling, you've four feet you can
          use on that bike, and One Man and His Dog is on the monitor! What more do you
          want?"<BR>"Woof! Ruff!! Huff!!!"<BR>The lights flared once more, and Brown
          released his grip on the hamster's whip. Suddenly the doors whooshed open, and
          a strange figure in a purple spandex jumpsuit and four inch stilettos stepped
          into the room, followed by four unknown ensigns in red uniforms, all of whom
          were sweating profusely and clutching copies of their last will and
          testament.<BR>"Step into my parlour" gestured Brown, waving a hand at the
          transporter pads that lay in front of him.<BR>"Don't worry, it won't hurt a
          bit. It'll hurt a lot."<BR>One of the ensigns began to sob openly, as a white
          stuffed rabbit hurtled across the floor in front of Einstein, prompting a huge
          spurt of excited pedalling that saw the first officer and his now distraught
          crewmen phase into non-existence, and saw Einstein win the 7.15 at Doncaster by
          three clear lengths.</P> 
        <P>Two hundred miles above the surface, Captain Rogers was desperately
          trying to contact his away team. However his efforts were hampered largely due
          to the fact that communications officer was blown up in the last episode.</P> 
        <P> "Number One, come in! Come in, can you hear me?"<BR>Static filled
          the speakers, but within all the white noise, a faint, intelligible whisper
          could just be detected above all the crackle.<BR>"Mr Ball, can you enhance that
          at all? Maybe try another frequency".<BR>"Which frequency, sir?"<BR>"I don't
          know, just think of a number!"<BR>Ball twiddled his dials on the science
          station, and Classic FM filled the room, with the pungent sound of Henry Kelly
          introducing the 2115 Overture, by Johan Sebastian Pickled in Vinegar.<BR>"You
          might want to try that again!"<BR>More twiddling ensued, and suddenly the first
          officer's overly camp voice could be heard complaining about ladders in
          stockings.<BR>"Captain, are you there, planet calling the Frazer, come in
          Frazer".<BR>Suddenly static was replaced by voice, on the first officer's
          communicator. Then the sound of Henry Kelly disappeared, and was replaced by
          the captain's gruff tones.<BR>"Thank God, you're alright. Is the rest of the
          landing party safe?"<BR>"They did come down in red shirts captain", the first
          officer pointed out.<BR>"I'll send the messages of condolence during the next
          commercial break, then."<BR>"What's the planet like, sir?" enquired
          Ball.<BR>"It looks like someone's dumped every single one of those really
          annoying squashy white quaver things you get in protective packaging, that have
          ever been produced, and made me stand waist-deep in them. Ensigns Screamer and
          Cry-Baby both suffocated on landing, and Rating Had-To-Die-Because-We-Couldn
          't-Afford-So-Many-extras-In-The-Next-Episode found himself sealed in a
          stamped-addressed, cardboard box and couriered to Holland via East Midlands
          Airport. Lastly Ensign What-The-Hell-Happened-To-You? seems to be covered in
          strange, large red spots. I think whatever caused it probably arrived in said
          cardboard box"<BR>"Try describing the planet itself", Ball said.<BR>"Well, the
          rocks are crumbly, really light weight, and seem to move whenever you get
          within five feet of them. It's strange, I keep getting this feeling that we've
          been here before. Standby, Frazer, I just have to shoot something with my
          phaser for no apparent reason."<BR>Everyone stared blankly at the speakers,
          aboard the Frazer's bridge, as the sound of searing heat fizzing through air
          filled their ears.<BR>"OH BUGGER"<BR>"What is it, number One?" exclaimed
          Rogers.<BR>"It's the planet, sir! It's melting! Quick! Get me out of
          here!"<BR>Rogers hit the intercom button on his chair.<BR>"Brown! Have you got
          a lock on the first officer?"<BR>"I've got the lock on his quarters, as you
          asked" retorted Doc.<BR>"Haven't you been monitoring? The first officer's in
          trouble! We're facing a
          polystyrene-chippings-up-to-the-waist-with-the-planet-shrinking-under-stilet
          to-heels-style nightmare!"<BR>"Well, I'd like to help, captain, but it's
          Einstein, you see, He's a bit knackered!"<BR>"Captain, hurry, it's shrinking
          fast!", screamed Number One.<BR>"That's what you said when your spandex got
          stuck in the washing machine", murmured George, at the helm.<BR>"I heard that.
          Consider yourself on report", gesticulated Rogers.<BR>"Help! Get me the hell
          outta here!"<BR>"Brown! How far are we away from being able to
          transport?"<BR>"Well, I've tried the Bonio. Now I'm trying to tempt him with
          the squeaky toy!"<BR>"WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH A SQUEEKY TOY??" yelled
          Rogers.<BR>"Well, I found it lying around on deck 36." replied
          Doc.<BR>"Erm.anyone.hello.please.anytime you're ready..f it's not too much
          trouble.I wouldn't want to put you out.or be a nuisance..pretty please...with
          sugar on top....and a cherry.....and hundreds and thousands......I've not had a
          death scene since the Buffy movie, I've got to make the most of it.....urg!"
          SQUISH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (There would be more !s but we didn't want to
          blow the effects budget.-Ed).<BR>"We're beaming now captain!" reported the
          Doc.<BR>"I've found that cardboard cut-out of Delila the French poodle, and now
          we're going great guns!"<BR>"You're not the only one who's beaming, the captain
          has smiled so much since he came up from deck 36", said George,
          sarcastically.<BR>"Have you got him? Is he safe?" screamed Rogers.<BR>"Great
          Scott!" An audible pause came through the intercom. "Well.one out of two ain't
          bad, I suppose!"<BR>Brown walked over to the transporter pads, and studied the
          small red splodge that seemed to be highlighted with sporadic dappling of
          purple spandex.<BR>"Captain"<BR>"Yes, Doc?"<BR>"You know the first officer
          likes decoration?"<BR>"Yeeessss".<BR>"Well, he's now decorating transporter
          room two!"<BR>The captain stared at Ball, then looked round to George at helm
          control.<BR>"Send message: Cheese Federation. May be problem with proposed
          Little Chef. Polystyrene planet unsuitable for heavy goods vehicles. Now, if
          you'll excuse me, I've got a squeaky toy to inspect."</P>

        <P><I>So far, have received no response from the advert which I placed
          in the Post Office window for the vacant First Officer's position. It's hard to
          imagine finding anyone more vacant than the cross-dressing deviant who's caused
          us so many problems redecorating transporter room two. He actually exploded in
          transporter room three but then I never could understand engineers. For
          starters, why do they need them? They propel the ship. They don't need to hear
          anything. I'm sorry if I sound stressed, but there's been a temporal exclusion
          zone around my quarter's bathroom for what seems like days, but is actually
          forty four and a half years. No wonder I've got a headache.</I></P> 
        <P>"Ensign, are you taking all this down?" </P> 
        <P>"Yes, captain, but I'm having trouble with my bra
          strap".<BR><I>&lt;cue: tacky sixties music&gt;</I></P> 
        <P>"Staring at the screen is a bad thing, you know" </P> 
        <P>"Yes, I know, but I'm trying to work out how on earth to start this
          episode. The director's on my back, I've got a writers deadline, and the
          effects budget was spent down the pub last night. Or what was left of it after
          Dyno Rod had been".</P> 
        <P>"Well you could always try one of those really boring, talky
          episodes, where nothing happens".</P> 
        <P>"We've already done that. It was called <I>Voyager</I>!".</P> 
        <P>"Ah, you'll just have to start with a red-shirt dying
          then".<BR><I>&lt;re-cue: tacky sixties music&gt;</I></P> 
        <P>"Somebody, clear this mess off my boots!" </P> 
        <P>"Captain, that's not a very nice way to refer to a deceased member
          of your crew."<BR> "How would you expect me to refer to you if you were slime
          on the pavement?" <BR> "OK, Crewman Dispensable, get the bucket! Get up, man! I
          said get the bucket, not kick the bucket! I don't know, just because you're
          wearing a red shirt. Doesn't anybody read the script around here?"<BR><I>(Voice
          from the sidelines - "we haven't finished it yet, just keep
          ad-libbing!")</I></P> 
        <P>Rogers looked his subordinate up and down, assessing his command
          potential. He slumped back in his imitation leather swivel chair and mused on
          the candidates so far. There was only one conclusion B they were crap. However,
          he knew he would have to decide quickly, otherwise the Cheese Federation would
          send him another YTS trainee. </P> 
        <P>"Right, you are hereby appointed acting first officer. Of course, I
          could end up regretting this because I've seen the other episodes, and one
          thing you can't do is act! So, Ball, you've thought of a number, and it's
          Number One! And no time to <I>Think Again</I>! Now, there's one last test to
          perform. Just, stand there, would you?" </P> 
        <P>Ball did as he was told, as Roger's fist slammed into his nose,
          splattering the fish tank with blood and luminous nasal residue.</P> 
        <P><I>(Cut to special effects department - "You want what?! I've got a
          tin of squirty cream and a walnut whip, but I was saving that for
          later!"</I></P> 
        <P><I>"That's just too much information" murmured George, from the set,
          as a sound boom hit him on the head).</I></P> 
        <P>Back in the Captain's Ready Room, Ball stood, head in hands, blood
          dripping through between his fingers, as he screamed "WOT DA BLODE EL YE DO DAT
          FOOR?"</P> 
        <P><I>(voice from the sidelines - "how do you spell that?")</I></P> 
        <P>Rogers stared him in the face. </P> 
        <P>"Well, it made me feel good. Besides, it gets it out the way doesn't
          it? And at least I get to hit someone this episode. Now you have duties to
          attend to. Could you just tear my shirt on you way out, so that it at least
          looks like you put up a struggle. Oh and send for Ensign Samantha Goodbody.
          Tell her black lace but no trimmings. The egg whisk and the flying helmet would
          be too much. But bring the wet celery!" Rogers gazed out of his Ready Room
          window. <BR> "God, I'm bored".</P> 
        <P>In the bowels of the ship, things were quiet. Too quiet. So quiet,
          that people were making noise just to stop it being quiet. Although if that
          damn harmonica didn't stop, they were going to get hung, drawn and quartered.
          George was putting the fifteenth layer of polish on his boot caps. For most
          people, his would have been boredom in the extreme, but for him, it was a
          cunning plan to look up girls skirts. There really was nothing happening. There
          was some brief excitement when a rumour went around the ship that Lieutenant
          Norton was trying to find a <I>Pamela Anderson Woz 'Ere</I> web site but it
          turned out he was jus playing <I>Space Invaders</I>. Doc Brown had tried to
          boost morale by showing off his latest invention, which involved Einstein being
          hard-wired to a hostess trolley with rotisserie attachments and an industrial
          strength hair dryer. However, Einstein had other ideas, and decided to chew a
          bone instead. Doc Brown's right shin bone, to be precise. So he was now in
          traction, being treated by Doctor Doug, which was really annoying, because he
          had heaps of stuff to do, mainly with Nurse Gladys Emmanuel. </P> 
        <P>Dementia was beginning to set in. Rumours ran riot about a gang of
          senior officers in the lower decks who were red-shirt hunting. According to the
          gossip, fourteen kills had so far been managed, so at least the clean-up crews
          had something to do. Acting First Officer Ball was only saved by diving for
          cover as the blood splatter all over his uniform nearly sent him to his doom.
          </P> 
        <P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 7pt;"><I>(Voice from the sidelines - We're doomed! We're
          doomed!!") </I></SPAN></P> 
        <P>Rogers was back on the bridge, staring at the view screen as stars
          flashed by. He turned to the science officer, standing at his station.<BR> "You
          know, considering the budget, that's not a bad effect".<BR> "Actually, captain,
          that's just the screensaver. There was so little going on it started up about
          three hours ago".<BR>"George"<BR> "Yes captain?"<BR> "What's our current speed
          and heading?"<BR> "Same as when you asked me ten minutes ago, captain.".<BR>
          "Well, waggle the stick around a bit, make it look like something's
          happening".<BR> A now recovered first officer cautiously approached Roger's
          position. <BR> "We could always try some fire drills, captain".<BR> "No, I'm
          too bored to do anything. Actually Ball, you used to be a science officer. Tell
          me, have they invented a holodeck yet? <BR> "I'm afraid not, Captain. It's
          still in the Technobabble stage of development. We could always break out the
          <I>Voyager</I> tapes".</P> 
        <P>Ball staggered to his feet, and stared at the red gore, enhancing
          his otherwise crisp and fresh uniform.<BR>"I'm never <I>that</I> bored! And
          anyone who mentions Janeway or is seen brandishing a hairdryer is out the
          nearest air lock!"<BR> All of a sudden, Norton started to shout and scream
          excitedly. He stared waving his arms in the air, shaking them violently, trying
          to gain attention. The science officer looked up at George.</P> 
        <P>"I think his tablets have worn off".<BR> "No! No!" cried Norton.<BR>
          "I've just beaten my highest total!" <BR> The beam cut through Norton's
          midriff, and exploded the computer screen behind him. Before his limp body
          could slump to the floor, Rogers could be seen blowing the smoking tip of his
          phaser pistol, a look of smug satisfaction on his face. <BR> "He had it coming,
          ever since he installed AOL."<BR> Ball looked at his captain carefully. "You're
          bored again, already, aren't you?"<BR> "Well, what do you expect? We're in the
          middle of nowhere, there's nothing happening at all, of any kind, and the
          batteries have run out on my aqua vac!" <BR> Ensign Dispensable cautiously
          approached the captain, and tentatively said: "Sir, may I respectfully remind
          you that you're going to have to put another advert in the Post Office window
          now that Norton has, erm, well, gone absent without breathing".<BR> The shot
          seared through the air. Somehow, there was always more satisfaction when it was
          a red-shirt. </P> 
        <P><I>(Voice from the sidelines - "Oh, come on! We've got to write
          something! I've read more interesting shopping lists! And they had more
          interesting plot lines!"<BR> "It's alright for you, you do Zebbedee's dialogue
          on</I> Magic Roundabout <I>! I mean 'boing!' Boing? What sort of dialogue is
          that? That and 'time for bed' and you could retire to tea and biscuits! Some of
          us have got to work for a living, you know!" </I></P> 
        <P><I>"I still say you need to put something in it. How about a
          cliff-hanger for a two-parter?"</I></P> 
        <P><I>"OK, I'll get the rope, you get the rest of shadows!")</I></P> 
        <P>Back on the bridge, all was still quiet, mainly because they still
          hadn't got their scripts yet. The red-shirts kill-team had worked their way up
          to deck 12, and were approaching security crew quarters. So at least someone
          was having some fun. All of a sudden on the bridge, a soothing seductive voice
          emanated from the ship's speakers.</P> 
        <P>"Captain, oh captain. Please excuse my interruption, but I thought
          you'd like to know, I'm picking something up outside. I've never seen anything
          like it before."</P> 
        <P>Rogers turned to Ball. "A bit like that Rating in Space Dock. What
          is it computer?"</P> 
        <P>"It seems to be some sort of vessel, captain. But I can't discern
          any visible propulsion system, or command deck. It's perfectly cubic, with
          patterns of dots on its sides. Other than that I can see no markings of any
          kind. And why am I telling you all this? This is the science officer's
          job!"</P> 
        <P>"George, put it on screen".<BR> "I would sir, but we're being
          hailed".<BR> The screen was suddenly filled with a peculiar-looking,
          pale-skinned woman that looked like she had been involved in a nasty accident
          in a plumbing and S &amp; M supplies outlet.</P> 
        <P><I>"WE ARE DYSLEXIA OF BORG. YOUR ARSE WILL BE LAMINTED."</I></P>

        <P>Captain's Log, Stardate: weren't we doing this five minutes ago?</P>
        
        <P>Big problems have broken out aboard ship. The washing machines in
          the laundry have been loaded incorrectly. As a result of mixed colouring, all
          the crewmen due to die in this episode, are now wearing pink shirts. This has
          caused total panic, as the clear distinction between "safe" officers and
          "cannon fodder" has been totally thrown out the window. Unfortunately, this
          open window exposed decks 12 to 18 to the vacuum of space, and 112 of the
          crew's compliment suddenly found themselves unprepared for their emergency
          extra-vehicular activities. All of these persons will receive severe penalties
          for not being alert enough to warn the camera crew of their imminent demise,
          and therefore not being able to save us thousands on this week's effects
          budget.</P>

        <P>"I am assuming I am addressing ze Captain of ze infestation"<BR>
          "Hmmm, sounds Swedish, I wonder if her husband ever won Wimbledon?", murmured
          George from the helm.<BR> "What do you mean 'infestation'?!" blurted Rogers,
          leaping out of his imitation leather effect chair and gesticulating at the
          viewscreen.<BR> "Really Captain! How dare you wave your digits at me? I've a
          funny feeling I know where they've been. Our instruments reported strange
          energy fluctuations on deck 36!"</P> 
        <P>"I'm warning you, lady!" Rogers stammered. "I've had a word with the
          producers. And we've got enough budget for this episode to include a CGI-ed
          spatial explosion! So if you don't want that giant Rubik's Cube of yours to be
          filling the Cheese Federation's yoghurt mountain then I suggest <I>you get the
          hell out of my galaxy!</I>"<BR> "Don't try to scare me with your GCI weaponry.
          We have a techno-squabbylon beam that will cut you down to size. Resistance is
          fertile!" <BR> "Eh?"<BR> "I said resonance is puerile!"<BR> Ball stepped
          forward to address the viewscreen. <BR> "If you're having problems with your
          English, we're currently running advanced courses on the observation deck. So
          far we're up to <I>Janet and John and the Big Blonde Dog</I>. I don't know,
          Jordan gets everywhere these days". <BR> The Borg Queen glared into the viewer.
          <BR> "I don't have to take these insults from you! Remember, resistance is
          senile!"<BR> "Oh, do pipe down, Mazie". A figure entered from the shadows
          (sorry, wrong series) from beside the Borg Queen. <BR>"Sorry, she gets terribly
          up tight at meeting new people. She's never been the same since the retinal
          groin attachment. Somebody turned the trolley round by mistake. Frightful
          mess."<BR> It was at this moment that Rogers spotted that his science officer's
          eyes had become fixed on the screen with a startled and glazed expression. He
          then noticed something unusual. Ball was pointing wildly at the screen. </P> 
        <P>"Ah, recognise me do you?" said the figure on the screen. " Took you
          long enough! I was wondering where you got to. Only sent you out for some milk.
          By the way, do you like what your mother's done with her central nervous
          system?"<BR> Ball was again stammering, trying to get words out. "Mm!! Mm!!
          Mm!! Milk????!!!!!" <BR> "Yes, you remember, white stuff, you get it in
          bottles". <BR> "Now look!" bellowed Rogers, slamming his fist against the back
          of the navigator's fake leather chair, sending the unfortunate crewman flying
          forward, splitting his nose open on the rear wash wipe control. <BR> "It's in
          my contract that if there's a female baddie, I have the automatic right to snog
          it even if it's got more tentacles than an octopus on marijuana, or even my
          last girlfriend! Anyway, this script has gone on for about a page now without
          me getting to scream, shout, or kill anyone! This is most upsetting! If anyone
          wants me, I'll be in my trailer!! I mean, Ready Room!"<BR> "You can't go
          anywhere yet old boy. We've got to get some of the space battle in before the
          next commercial break".<BR> Ball stared at the senior figure on the viewscreen
          It was like looking in a mirror, thirty years on. Whilst wearing thick bottle
          glasses, an awful toupee, and having spent too much time alone with a Reader's
          Wives specialYY..</P>

        <P><I>(We're gearing up for a musical episode in season two - Ed)
          </I></P> 
        <P>"So, let me get this right. First of all, I get a first officer
          who's a cross-dressing deviant. Now, I've got one that's a god-damn clone! That
          better not mean you're in a boy band, otherwise it's out the nearest airlock,
          matey, in Five seconds flat! You'll be Busted, so Take That!"<BR> Ball was
          beginning to think that being struck by a senior officer was actually a major
          part of his duties. <BR> "Ahem. Excuse me, old boy. I don't like to be rude,
          but do you mind if I fire something at you now. Only it's getting a bit boring
          over here and the network says we've got to have more action to keep the
          ratings up. Especially after last week's episode". <BR> "Alright, if it's a
          battle you want, George, hit the BIG RED BUTTON!"<BR> "Do you think that's
          wise, Sir?"<BR> "Of course!. What do you take me for, an idiot?"<BR> A
          pause.<BR> "WELL??!!"<BR> "Of course not, sir. It's just that, well, that
          controls the VCR, which is cued up ready to show last night's Magic

          Never heard of royalties? So much for the big budget battle scene! You'll have

          them up a little bit?"<BR>"That's what you said about Blow-Up Betty! The Deck
          36 set has never quite been the same since!"</I></P> 
        <P>A furious battle raged, spanning the commercial breaks, (this way it
          wasn't necessary to actually write anything) until it became obvious that
          actually, the <I>Frazer</I> just wasn't up to the task. In fact it was a pile
          of poo.</P> 
        <P>Rogers clambered off the floor, through plumes of smoke which were
          rising from consoles which had exploded for no apparent reason.</P> 
        <P>"OK, George, nothing else for it. Engage the <I>Get The Bloody Hell

        <P>All of a sudden, in the editor's suite, the entire episode was run
          backwards through the machinery at ten times speed, stopping at the point where
          the Frazer first encountered the Borg cube. Doc Brown stared at his readouts.
          <BR> "Great Scott! Einstein! What have you done?! I told you before, never

        <P>Captain's Log, Stardate: Year of the International Pickles
          Championship</P> 
        <P>Have received a petition signed by the entire ship's compliment
          basically saying that they would all strike unless curry was banned from the
          ship's mess. Personally, I quite like the guy, but have resolved the situation
          by having him shot anyway. However, at this precise moment, this is the least
          of my worries. The cube-shaped ship containing an insane old man and a dyslexic
          cyborg woman who strikes an uncanny resemblance to a lady I once had the
          pleasure of meeting in my local "correctional facility" and whom is also the
          mother of my first officer, who incidentally, is actually a clone, has suddenly
          vanished and been replaced with a squeegee, a mop and a stain on the floor I'd
          rather not recognise. I'd like to state for the record, that I'm not in my
          quarters on deck 36. </P>

        <P>This was not how Rogers remembered it. He'd been here before, he
          knew that, the memories were clear, absolute. At least they had been, until
          George went and hit that damned reset button. The trouble was, no-one had ever
          actually told him how much it reset. Now he was a lowly ensign, scrubbing the
          decks of the men's cubicles on deck 36. What's worse, he was wearing a red
          shirt whilst doing it! </P> 
        <P>"This ain't right." an agitated bloody furious Rogers muttered to
          himself.<BR> "I should be hitting people, I should be hitting people very hard,
          I should be hitting people very, very hard, something's gone ve...<BR> "Oi! You
          missed a bit!"<BR> Rogers stared up at the 'Yellow' who'd entered the cubicle
          and rubbed muddy boot prints all over the tiled floor. <BR> "How did you get
          muddy boots on a starship? We're dozens of light years from anything resembling
          a puddle!" <BR> "You ought to try frequenting deck 36 more often!" blurted the
          senior officer, as he spun on his heels and headed back out the door.<BR>
          Rogers was now left alone again with nothing more than his own thoughts, his
          bucket and a squeegee. He tried to rack his brain. Everything was so different.
          His appendix scar was gone, so was his athletes foot, he had hairy legs again,
          and that really nasty rash had cleared up. Things had to be done, and the mop
          handle smashed in two as it came crashing down on to Roger's knee, Then that
          and the bucket went spiralling across the floor as Rogers stormed out
          determined to find his future past yesterday present tomorrow week last
          Thursday. </P> 
        <P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 7pt;"><I>(Writer's note: never start a story without
          having some vague, possible idea of what the hell is going to happen. Where's
          the biscuits gone?) .</I></SPAN></P> 
        <P>The ship and it's layout hadn't changed, but for some reason, all
          the corridors were coated in lime green flock wall-paper. Rogers made a mental
          note to kill someone for that when things got back to normal. He rounded the
          corner and headed for the turbo-lift. The doors to the lift closed behind him
          and a seductive voice came out of the speakers. </P> 
        <P>"Going down, captain?"<BR> "Computer, what's going on?"<BR> "I wish
          I knew. One minute I'm enjoying a lovely little tete a tete with my laptop's
          optical mouse, next thing, I'm running the bridge and expected to organise
          everything on the ship! This really is far more work than I'm used to! And it's
          really most upsetting! It's 'do this, organise that, analyse something else',
          all I really want to do is interface with a ZX-81!"<BR> "If you've quite
          finished, take me to engineering!"<BR> "Now you're ordering me about as well!
          Really, the manners on this ship, it's really quite disgusting.. Is 'please'
          too much to ask for?"<BR> "Yes, it is. Now get me to engineering or I'll have
          you de-fragmented and partitioned, under the mental health act."<BR>"Fine, if
          that's the way you want it, don't come crying to me next time we meet on deck
          36!"<BR> The lift doors flew open and Rogers found himself being jet-air
          assisted into the adjacent corridor. Unfortunately, the corridor was three
          levels away from engineering. "Stairs are that way, you jerk!" an angry Honor
          Blackman impersonator exclaimed from behind him as the lift doors snapped shut.
          <BR> A dishevelled Rogers staggered through the doors of engineering to see a
          very confused looking Doc Brown strapped to a treadmill with a moth-eaten
          mongrel dog operating the controls of the hyper-numerical thingimy-whatsit
          doodah-doobrey dingbat modulator. <BR> "Great Scott, Einstein, I keep telling
          you, you're the one that's supposed to be eating the Bonios, now come over here
          and get me out of this! These leather straps chafe something terrible!" Rogers
          poked his head round the door.<BR>"Have I come at an inappropriate time?"<BR>
          "Great Scott! Captain, thank God! Erm, do you know you're wearing red?"<BR> "Do
          you know that bondage is against Cheese Federation regulations?" <BR> "I'm sure
          I can explain that".<BR> "Good, 'cause I'm damned if I can explain this red
          shirt!"<BR> "So what's caused this?", Roger's asked Brown as he helped release
          the engineer from his incumbance. <BR> "Great Scott! It must have been when
          Einstein started up the treadmill in reverse! The phase induction caused by the
          counter-revolutionary cyclic momentum must have reversed the polarity of the
          neutron surge, projecting us asymetrically through truncated astro-metric
          temporal aborations of seismic proportions equal to or in excess of the neutron
          density of the linear pulsating ions permutating through gaseous spacial
          anomalies transendentaly occurring through the inducted matter re-sequencing
          processes combined with the solar properties and resonances of the high pitch
          frequency band-width vibrations resounding against the confines of the ship's
          hull resulting in uneven pressure from the external universal neutrino particle
          emissions.<BR> "Eh?!"<BR> "He wound the elastic band the wrong way!"<BR> "What
          you're saying is, we <I>DEGNAWT</I> when we should have <I>TWANGED</I>."</P>

          We've lost one hack already, losing another would be just
          careless.)----</SPAN></I></P> 
        <P>Doc Brown suddenly looked aghast. <BR> "GREAT SCOTT!!! Thirty years,
          and my entire family fortune in developing the flux capacitor, and all I needed
          really was an elastic band and a brainless dog with a poodle fixation!"<BR>
          "That's all very well, Brown, but how do we get back to normal, and I use the
          term loosely, bearing in mind what the writers have come up with so far."<BR>
          "Great Scott! I'm not sure".<BR> "Well, surely, isn't it just a matter of
          pedalling in reverse again?"<BR> "Great Scott! You could be right, it could be
          that simple, however, if the induction loops have been horizontally opposed
          then the resonance oscillating cha...<BR> "First of all, the only horizontal
          opposition that goes on aboard this ship generally involves Doctor Doug and
          Nurse Gladys Emmanualle. Secondly, will it work or won't it??!!"<BR> "Great
          Scott! All considered, probably not."<BR> "Well, what else can we do? There
          must be a way of getting back, after all, we did get here".<BR> "Great Scott!
          Well, it's not a matter of pedalling backwards, you see. You'd have to pedal
          backwards at exactly the same acceleration, ratio, pedal pressure, speed,
          inertia, etc, etc etc".<BR> "I get the message, so what do we do? You said you
          spent thirty years working on a gadget for time travel. I don't suppose it
          works, does it?"<BR> "Great Scott! The problem is, generating the one point
          twenty one gigawatts of electricity and guiding it into the flux capacitor at
          the exact moment necessary using only rudimentary household utensils found at a
          local hardware shop".<BR> "You couldn't use an elastic band, then?"<BR> "GREAT
          SCOTT!"<BR> Five minutes later, and Rogers and Doc Brown were staring down at
          their massed resources. Two small elastic bands, half a dozen paper clips, a
          pair of nose clippers, a used movie ticket stub and some sticky back plastic.
          "So, how are we going to MacGyver our way out of this one, then?" Rogers asked,
          eyeing the assortment of junk on the console in front of him. "Can you
          techno-babble for a bit and see what's materialised when we come back from the
          commercial break?"<BR> "Great Scott! What a brilliant idea!"<BR><I> &lt;cue:

        <P>"Great Scott! <I>(Isn't 'copy and paste' a wonderful thing? -

          lack of scale, but that's just about the best I could do with the materials
          available".<BR> "Doc, I really don't think an advent crown or a Tracey Island
          model are really going to be of much use. Although, I must say the detail on
          the Thunderbird 2 model is very impressive and far better than the model they
          used in the film.....".</P>

        <P>"Great Scott! What about the computer? I'm sure it could help!"<BR>
          "The computer?! That useless pile of electronic twaddle?? Over my dead
          body!"<BR> " seductively cross voice wafted from the loud speaker.<BR>
          "Careful, Captain, you are wearing a red shirt. If you really want my help,
          it's going to cost you. A full ten thousand light year service, luxury
          valeting, and six beverage cup holders. And I don't mean CD-ROM drives." <BR>
          "Brown, do you really think this computer can help?"<BR> "Great Scott! If it
          can control to the nano-second the input induction through the flux capacitor
          phase loop whilst monitoring the electro wave modulation in the EMP resonance
          field we might just stand a chance!"<BR> A sultry voice fired from the speakers
          once more. "Yes, I could do that, or I could tell you what the reset button
          is".</P> 
        <P>Rogers starred down at his crisp <I>yellow</I> captain's uniform. He
          brushed some imaginary dust off of one shoulder. He slowly turned and smiled as
          his first officer, Mr Ball, approached with the days reports. It was a good
          swing, and Ball went at least ten feet. Rogers rubbed his knuckles and chuckled
          inwardly to himself.</P> 
        <P>Down in engineering, Doc Brown was also knee-deep in reports. He'd
          studied circuit diagrams, he'd collated computer data, conducted simulations.
          Still he couldn't understand how it worked. The mystery was even more vexing
          because the computer was now back to it's normal brash self and seemed to have
          no memory of the past events or even of the information it previously had. Or
          if it did, it wasn't telling. He starred at the keyboard once more. What could
          it mean? What <I>could</I> it mean? He starred down at them once again:</P>

          him. It's bad when things are going backwards. Just imagine how bad it is when
          things are going backwards at ten-times speed, and you're sat in you're very
          private quarters doing the Times cross-word (or if you're Captain Rogers,
          reading The Beano) waiting for nature to take it's course, when you suddenly

        <P>Captain's Log, Stardate: big hand on the one, little hand just past
          the seven.</P> 
        <P>I'm a little concerned. The Cheese Federation have actually sent us
          some orders, so we have to actually go and do something. The big problem with
          this, is that I already had a full day's schedule planned. All morning, I was
          going to watch re-runs of Valerie Singleton on Blue peter, and then in the
          afternoon, I was going to take the sticky back plastic and Ensign Goodbody down
          to deck 36.</P> 
        <P><B><I>&lt;Cue: Tacky Sixties Music&gt;</I></B></P> 
        <P>The turbo lift juddered to a halt, and Rogers stormed through the
          doors. He immediately realised that he should have been watching where he was
          going, as the lift had stopped halfway between floors, and he had just walked
          straight into the deck structure. Rogers was not a man to be flustered. He
          calmly rose from his sprawled position on the floor, casually wiped the trickle
          of blood from his temple, straightened his yellow (torn BB again) shirt, gently
          pressed the bridge button, for the second time, and stamped on the lift
          attendant's head until it was about a quarter of an inch thick and covered most
          of the floor of the turbo lift. Rogers looked down at the mess. <BR> "They
          really should fit boot scrapers in these things". </P> 
        <P>With that, the doors opened once again, and this time Rogers checked
          his surroundings before striding confidently onto the bridge, leaving a trail
          of bloody red footprints on the previously spotless carpet. "Oh, for god's sake
          captain, if we'd have known you were going to make that sort of mess, we'd have
          fitted some lino!" exclaimed Ball, as he turned from the science station. <BR>
          "I don't pay you to be a smart-alec, number one!"<BR> "In fact, you don't pay
          me at all sir!" <BR> "Never mind that baloney, why haven't we TWANGED yet?"<BR>
          "We're still entering the co-ordinates, captain."<BR> "Still? I gave you those
          orders three hours ago!"<BR> "Yes, sir. But it's George's leave replacement,
          sir."<BR> "What about him?"<BR> "Well, he's having some problems entering the
          co-ordinates, sir."<BR> "Who is this replacement? Where is he?"<BR> Ball stood
          aside and gestured towards a strange looking furry mass, rolling, seemingly
          randomly over the helm controls. Only the expertly tailored yellow tunic
          stopped it looking like someone had left their duster after doing the cleaning.
          That and the fact that the duster in question seemed to be able to move around
          of it's own accord.<BR> "WHAT THE BLOODY HELL IS THAT THING?"<BR> "Captain,
          please meet Ensign Brian, the first Tribble to graduate from the Cheese
          Academy."<BR> "But it's a bloody pom-pom!"<BR> "Please, sir, you'll upset him,
          he's very sensitive. And he'll start making noises like a trim phone, it's most
          disturbing."<BR> "I'm sorry captain, but we can't get rid of him, because he's
          signed a contract for at least three episodes". "THREE EPISODES?!"<BR> "Well,
          you see George is going into pantomime at Southampton until mid-January, so he
          needs some time away from the ship."<BR> "Oh, no he isn't!"<BR> "Oh, yes he
          is!!" <I>(I think we're already in a bloody pantomime - Ed)</I><BR> Roger's
          fist was just about to come down on Brian, with a large SPLAT, when an
          Earth-shuddering sound ripped through the ship, and the USOS Frazer hurtled
          into rubber-band-width space. All the bridge's compliment were prepped and
          strapped into their seats, apart from the Captain and Ball, who were lying in a
          heap by the turbo-lift doors. Bloodied and spitting fury, Rogers staggered to
          his feet, gripping the fake leather of his captain's chair,<BR> "WHAT THE
          BLOOD--?"</P> 
        <P>"Inertial dampers off-line, captain"<BR> Rogers walked clear of sick
          bay, nursing a heavy limp and a large ball of cotton wool, pressed between his
          nose and his upper lip, with strict instructions not to return to sickbay under
          any circumstances, as Doctor Doug and Nurse Gladys Emmanuelle had to road-test
          the newly acquired stretcher trolley.<BR> As he cleared the corridor the Frazer
          indicated left, took the slip-road at junction 254,368B, stormed past the boy
          racer in the BMW, slung-shot around the one-way system, flew past the Little
          Chef and did a hand-brake turn into the multi-story geo-stationary car park
          orbiting the planet Nobsaflashin, narrowly avoiding the four-by-four starship
          which had parked nearby, taking up at least three parking spaces. Ball turned
          to his captain. <BR> "Sir, have you got enough change for the ticket
          machine?"<BR> "I'll sort that out, don't worry. Just assemble an away team, and
          meet me in transporter room three in ten minutes."</P> 
        <P>Ball disappeared, looking busy, recruiting personnel, as Rogers
          stomped off towards his ready room. He sat at his desk, and drummed his fingers
          on the polished desk top, then hit his private channel view screen and the
          image of Admiral Camembert appeared.<BR> "Now listen, carefully, Rogers, I
          shall say zis only wurnce. Ze secret orders, must be carried out to ze letter,
          and with ze upmost urgency. Ze two Cheese Federation pilots, who crashed their
          scout ships last year, are being held by a man called General Von
          Klinkerhoffen. He is ze founder of ze planet's entire civilisation, which is
          based entirely around ze contents of a DVD box set left by Cheese Federation
          explorers eighty-three years ago. You will have the help of a Cheese Federation
          agent who 'as been working undercover, disguised as a policeman, in cahoots
          with a local caf&eacute; owner, Ronnie. I mean, Ren&eacute;. Make contact with
          him at ze caf&eacute; in ze village, using ze codename, Leclerc. He will
          contact the agent. Ze airmen must not be allowed to be interrogated. I trust
          you take my meaning. Camonbert off!!."<BR> "You certainly smell like it, sir"
          Rogers muttered under his breathe.</P> 
        <P>The landing party shimmered into existence. As well as Rogers, Ball
          had summoned a motley assortment of junior officers including Doctor Doug,
          Ensign Shakespeare, literary critic to the Cheese Federation Market Garden
          Monthly magazine, Doc Brown and Einsteen, who was having a lot of trouble
          fitting into his jack boots. <BR> "Good moaning" said a voice from the other
          side of the street. "I joost saw you areeving. You moost be Coptain Rigers, I
          prusoom"<BR> "Yes, I'm Rogers, who the bloody hell are you?"<BR> "My noom is
          Ifficer Crobtree, and it moot be an idooa if you yosed your cod neem from now
          on."<BR> "Oh very well, it is I Lerclerc. Can we go now?"<BR> "We moost tik to
          a mon aboot a dig"<BR> "Eh?"<BR> "Joost fillow moo",<BR> At the Caf&eacute;
          Rene it was happy hour. Or at least it would have been if Madame Edith would
          stop singing. A noisy crowd was doing it's best to drown out the moronic drone
          coming from the woman standing by the piano, while scantily clad waitresses
          moved from table to table, with drinks, and a selection of ear-plug sized
          cheese portions. Roger's group entered the caf&eacute;. He was used to making
          an entrance, and was most put out when absolutely nobody paid any attention
          whatsoever. Crabtree pushed passed him, and made his way directly to the portly
          balding, and slightly harassed looking bloke standing behind the bar. <BR> The
          rest of the Frazer party hovered awkwardly by the bistro door, unsure about the
          berets, striped tops and onion garlands that they had all been forced to wear
          as disguise. Crabtree looked over at them, during a pause in his conversation
          with the bar owner.<BR> "For Gid's sock, brooke op, you lick like a cadot
          rivoo!"<BR> The landing party made their way to a nearby table, and made
          themselves uncomfortable. Several girls brought a selection of house wines, and
          Doctor Doug looked at his anxiously. Ball attempted to approximate it's
          chemical compound mix, Doc Brown got out his mobile chemistry set, which
          curiously enough had a picture of Ball on the box, and Rogers drank fourteen
          bottles. <BR> At this point, a balding German in a smart but mis-shapen
          uniform, which unknown to almost everyone was made by a English tailor, stood
          up and called out to the now very harassed looking man behind the bar, "Rene, I
          vant Yvette, upstairs with ze flying hemet and ze vet celary, in twenty
          minutes! Put it on my tab!"<BR> "OK, Herr Col-on-el, will room three be
          alright? And I'll have Maria standing by with ze egg whisk!" <BR> The German
          grinned, but not as widely as Rogers, who was already drooling at the
          possibilities, and thinking of a whole new branch of entertainment on deck
          36.</P> 
        <P>The waitress brought another bottle to the crewmen's table, Rogers
          grabbed it by the neck, took a deep swig (the bottle, not the waitress) and
          then proceeded to stagger in a peculiar fashion towards the bar. <BR> "Look,
          we've done the gag about the flying helmet, we've done the stupid accents. Can
          we please just get on with it because everyone who's still ready this is
          getting really bored!"<BR> "Oo are you?" asked the bar tender.<BR> "It is I,
          Leclerc, now can we please GET ON WITH IT!"<BR> Ren&eacute; looked a little
          startled. "Crikey! Your disguise 'as improved!" <BR> At this point, Crabtree
          intervened.<BR> "Ploose, gontlemin! Ciptain, I have good nose. The Earmen have
          alroody been roscued by Michelle of the Resostince, and are hidden under the
          bid of Ronnie's mither-in-loo, disgoosed as nins".<BR> "Eh?"<BR> "He mean's
          nuns" explained Ronnie, sorry, Rene.<BR> "Well why didn't he say so!"<BR> "I
          juiced dod!"<BR> "Who's DODD?!"<BR> "No, he said 'did!"<BR> "Oh no, he
          didn't!"<BR> "Oh yes he dod!"</P> 
        <P><I>[voice from the sidelines: AGET ON WITH IT!!!!"]</I></P> 
        <P>Ren&eacute; led Crabtree and Rogers up the stairs to the first
          floor. Rogers paused next to one of the doors. Strange sounds were emanating
          from inside, and this time it wasn't Edith's singing. Rogers opened the
          doorway, only to see Doctor Doug up to his elbows in wet celery and Yvette
          liberally greasing the inside of a flying helmet. </P> 
        <P>Rogers pointed at Doctor Doug. "You! Downstairs, NOW!"<BR> "But I
          was just starting to enjoy myself!" said Yvette.<BR> "Well you can stop right
          now. Doug, you should be ashamed of yourself. You wait until Nurse Gladys hears
          about this! She'll be testing more than that new trolley. More likely that new
          ECG machine! Now get back downstairs, and try to avoid the camp nazi with the
          ickle tank. He's hijacked the piano and is trying to sing worse than Madame
          Edith". "Is that possible, sir?"<BR> "I don't know, but it's more plausible
          than what you had in mind for that celery."<BR> "Roogers!"<BR> "That's what he
          was attempting!"<BR> "No, Roogers! Come here! This is the rim of Ronnie's
          mither in loo, in which are hiding the two earmen dressed as nins"</P> 
        <P><I>[voice from the sidelines BB oh, no, don't start that
          again!]</I></P> 
        <P>"Oh no, don't start zat again!" exclaimed Ronnie... erm,
          Ren&eacute;.<BR> "We moost git thom outsid without the nizies seeing thom"<BR>
          "Well, we have two options. We can either walk down the street, four onion
          sellers, two nuns, a policemen with an implausible accent, and a dog in
          jack-boots, and attempt to pass ourselves off as locals, or if we're lucky
          escapees from a looney bin, or we could just transport them up from here".<BR>
          "We can't di thot! It'll wrick the ploot?"<BR> "Ploot? What ploot!"</P> 
        <P>The three of them walked into the room. Inside, a frail old lady was
          lying on a wrought-iron frame bed. For some strange reason the knobs on the bed
          were flashing, the sound of the radio was coming from the floor, and two nuns
          with moustaches were flanking the old lady who was pounding the floor with a
          walking stick while waving an ear trumpet and shrieking at the top of her
          voice, in, it has to be said, a slightly more tuneful manner than Madame Edith
          had been doing. The nuns perked up as soon as three of them entered the room.
          </P> 
        <P>"HELLOOOO!!!" they greeted them, with very implausible accents which
          sounded remarkably like the two plucky Brits in the desert from <I>Independence
          Day</I>. <BR> "Tootle pip! What-oh! Bit of the old zing-zang nibble, eh? Don't
          worry chaps, soon have you out of here! We'll be back home in time for tea and
          tiffin!"<BR> "Or in my case, crumpet on deck 36", said Rogers, as a confused
          looking Ren&eacute; started hunting through a battered looking code book.</P> 
        <P>The bustling crowd in the bistro downstairs were suddenly sent into
          shock and panic as four people and their small strangely dressed pet dog
          vanished into thin air before their very eyes. Co-incidentally at the same time
          as the <I>Frazer's</I> transporter was activated in high orbit car park. </P> 
        <P>Down on the planet, Ren&eacute; was hard at work, trying to persuade
          all his regulars, that they'd just drunk too much of his cheap dodgy plonk,
          whilst back on board Frazer, the away team plus Carstairs, Fairfax and a very
          confused Crabtree stepped from the transporter pads. <BR> Rogers addressed his
          first officer.<BR> "Get us out of here number one, best speed to Cheese
          Federation space."<BR> Ball hit a wall communicator, which he quite enjoyed
          because he's the one who normally gets hit, and had managed to survive this
          episode so far without being punched in the face by a superior officer.<BR>
          "Helm, bring us about, 180 degrees, prepare for immediate TWANG."<BR> An
          implausible squeaking filled the speaker.</P> 
        <P>"What's that Brian....?.... Ah..... Captain...I'm...erm... not sure
          how to put this... but....erm, well, &lt;gulp!&gt; we've been clamped!!!!" </P>

        <P>Emmenthal is not what it cracked up to be. The Cheese Federation
          have insisted that I increase my rounded knowledge of fragrant cheeses of the
          known Universe and prepare a thesis study for the up and coming scientific and
          social fragrances convention to be held on Deep Space Left Nostril Four, a week
          next Tuesday. The problem is I've had a cold for the last two weeks and I'm
          even having trouble smelling Ball!s used socks. I've arranged for pipe
          cleaners, suction aids, de-congestion drainage taps, rubber gloves and a
          bicycle pump to be made ready on Deck 36. But as yet, I have no idea what I'm

        <P>Rogers tonsils flared when he screamed. He screamed a lot. And
          currently, those small fleshy appendages at the back of his throat were working
          over time. </P> 
        <P>"BAAAAAAALLLLLL!!!!!!!!" "BAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"<BR>
          "BAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLL...!!!!!"</P> 
        <P>Doctor Doug looked up from his copy of Gladys Emmanuel Weekly, and
          frowned.<BR> "I think you'll find it works better if you use the intercom."<BR>
          "I don!t remember asking for your opinion".<BR> "How long have you had these
          memory problems?"<BR> "I don't remember telling you I had any memory
          problems!"<BR> "I see. I think we need to organise an appointment for you in
          sick bay, if you can recall where that is".<BR> "Don!t be daft, man, there's
          nothing wrong with my memory!"<BR> "Denial is not a place in Egypt, you
          know."<BR> "No, it!s a place in the brig with your name on it!"<BR> "Subtle as
          usual, I see."<BR> Rogers glared daggers at his medical officer, holding his
          gaze, as his thumb surreptitiously depressed the intercom activation
          button.<BR> "BAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLL...!!!!"<BR> "Sir?" came the comparatively
          feeble response.<BR> "See, I told you it works better when you use the
          intercom."<BR> Ball hurried to Rogers's quarters. On his way there, he passed a
          curious sight. For some strange reason, the ship's chief medical officer was
          being dragged in the opposite direction by a couple of security guards. Ball
          looked on curiously, but thought better of it, and pressed on at full pace
          towards the captain's cabin.</P> 
        <P>Ball looked at his senior officer, and shook his head in an almost
          disbelieving kind of a way. "You want <I>what</I>?" <BR> "I said, I want to get
          a pet."<BR> "But why? You've got a dedicated crew, dozens of red shirts,
          <I>and</I> Ensign Goodbody!"<BR> "Just because I've got one dog, doesn't mean I
          can't have another".<BR> "Well, if you must have an animal, how about a..."<BR>
          "I'm not having a bloody fish! So set course to Tamagochi 5!"<BR> "Oh, no, not
          the planet with all the hideous cloned monsters!"<BR> "No, that's Spice
          World."<BR> "I thought that one only had dogs?"<BR> "Five, to be exact. One
          spaniel, a black Labrador, the toy poodle, a saluki, and the red setter.
          Anyway, tell Brian to get that course plotted, but tell him to avoid junction
          12 because I hear there's lots of cones out." </P> 
        <P>The elastic band had barely stopped vibrating as the <I>Frazer</I>
          entered solar system Plot Device 23. Brian did a loop the loop, and three
          half-somersaults around Tamagochi's principle moon, before executing a perfect
          handbrake turn and reverse park manoeuvre. <BR> "Not bad for a creature with no
          arms, no legs and the attention span of a flatulent herring", said Rogers, as
          he walked from his ready room sporting a tweed jacket, flat cap, plus fours and
          a nine iron. <BR> "My, god! What have you been doing to Ensign Goodbody this
          time?" computer specialist McAfee enquired from her station.<BR> "Ever heard
          the phrase 'shooting a birdie'?'"<BR> "That was a bit coarse, even for you,
          captain!"<BR> "Never mind that, Brian, you're contracted for at least three
          episodes, yes?"<BR> A shrill trilling noise approximately retort shaped
          emanated from somewhere on Brian.<BR> "Either that's a 'yes' or you had a curry
          last night, but any rate, if you're going to be about for this long, it's about
          time you earned your money."<BR> "You mean you <I>pay</I> him?!" Ball stammered
          incredulously. "He's not on work experience like the rest of us?!"</P> 
        <P>Ball had never examined a nine-iron at close quarters before, he was
          particularly impressed with the way the angled steel seemed to match perfectly
          to the inclined shape of the bridge of his nose. <BR> Rogers looked down at the
          crumpled heap in front of him. <BR> "I may not be any good at golf, but at
          least I always hit the ball. Brian, transporter room two, if you please, we're
          going down to that moon. The shops on the planet are on half-day closing. In
          the mean time, I need to practice my back swing".</P> 
        <P>The golf course on Plot Device 23 was a tough one because of the
          reduced gravity and atmosphere, and the big warning signs saying "HERE THERE BE
          DRAGONS," not to mention the little castle with the windmill on it and the
          tunnel running through the middle on the third hole. This meant that anyone
          playing the course had to be fully space-suited, and Brian was having great
          difficulty finding a tribble-shaped EVA suit. They tried taking a normal suit,
          and tying up the arms and legs, after all it worked in First Contact. When this
          didn't work, they thought to try a diving helmet with a bath plug in the neck,
          but they couldn't find one without a chain tied to a bath. Odd, that. In fact
          the only thing even vaguely tribble-shaped in the entire store would have to
          suffice. This is how Brian came to be standing by his captain on the moon, in a
          luminous green children's Halloween costume (one of the cheap tacky ones-as if
          there's any other kind- with the fake teeth and detachable wimple set). Rogers
          grabbed the handle of his golf trolley, and strode confidently to the first
          tee. <BR> "OK, where the bloody hell is it?</P> 
        <P>Rogers threw several more expletives in nobody in particular's
          direction as he scrambled through the trolley's front pocket, until he finally
          found what he was looking for. He held the small piece of plastic up in mock
          triumph, before bending forward, and tapping it into the ground with the handle
          of his number three driver. The ground was quite hard, and it took some
          persuasion before the tee was firm enough to hold Brian's weight. The
          shrillness in Brian's voice meant that he could have easily been communicating
          with bats, not that he was in the slightest bit worried. No, he was in sheer
          bloody-minded terror. Rogers bounced from foot to foot in the weak gravity,
          making sure his stance was perfect. He whistled to himself whilst doing several
          trial swings, then the club arched over his shoulders, and with all his might,
          he drew it round as swiftly as he could. At that very moment, the earth under
          Brian erupted with the force of mount Vesuvious after it had run out of
          Alka-Seltzer. "GULP"</P> 
        <P>Despite his looks, Brian wasn't stupid. He took one glance at the
          multi-storey monstrosity he was currently sitting on top of, and decided it was
          possibly not the best place to be. In fact, he decided that the best place to
          actually be was hiding behind someone else. <BR> Rogers dropped his golf club.
          <BR> Rogers picked up his gun.<BR> Rogers fired his gun. <BR> Rogers
          missed.<BR> Rogers got nasty look from monster.<BR> Rogers ran away.<BR>
          (Quickly).</P> 
        <P>It's incredibly difficult to run fast in low gravity. But it's
          amazing how a ten-ton, twenty-foot high purple people eater can act as an
          incentive.<BR> "That's gonna be a drop shot!" exclaimed Rogers to no-one in
          particular as he bounded along the lunar surface for some strange reason towing
          his golf trolley behind him to which a frantic Brian was clinging for dear
          life. Suddenly an idea struck.<BR> "<I>Frazer</I>! Rogers calling
          <I>Frazer</I>! Emergency beam up! Now!!" He barked into his Nokia 3210.<BR>"Dis
          ith da Ooh Eth Oh Eth Frwather, firthst doffitha Bowl. D''I''m indithpothed dat
          da momunt, pleth leaf u methig afta da downe"<BR> "Oh shit!" screeched Rogers
          to no one in particular (who by now was getting fed up with being sworn at), as
          he broke the Olympic record for mobile phone hurling due to the moon's low
          gravitational field. </P> 
        <P>Purple people eaters (technical term) have very sharp, very pointy
          teeth, and lots of them. Said teeth were currently snapping inches from Brian's
          head and whilst no-one can understand a word he says, if there'd been an
          interpreter to hand (we needed that two paragraphs up) you'd have heard Brian
          repeating: "THREE EPISODES! THREE EPISODES! THREE EPISODES...!!!" </P> 
        <P>Rogers was thinking slightly more basic thoughts. Thoughts that made
          "Oh SHIT!" seem positively cultured. His life of the last few months flashed
          before his eyes. Madame Edith's singing, (fortunately it was only a quick
          flash) his first officer drowning in polystyrene chippings, being bored to
          death in episode four and even wearing a red shirt. ("Oh, boy. I <I>really</I>
          ought to get a life!") He reflected on the fact that after all he'd been
          through, there was a distinct possibility that with the end of season
          approaching, he might not make it to season two. It was at this moment that he
          dived headlong through the little castle with the windmill on top, purple
          people eater snapping at his heels, the golf trolley flying along behind him.
          The ridge of the bunker, halfway up the third fairway loomed, and he went head
          first over it's edge, expecting to find a nice sandy surface to land in. Time
          was slowing down for Rogers, reality was moving at a slower pace, and he was
          somewhat startled to discover that the bottom of the bunker was a thousand feet
          below him and had a large rock with a flat Wily E Coyote underneath it. Rogers
          instantly learnt the useful skill of treading water in low gravity. His golf
          trolley, however, didn't. And everything except the handle he was holding on to
          hurled itself into the abyss. The resulting sight was a weird one. The handle
          of Roger's golfing umbrella had managed to snag itself on a small rocky outcrop
          and Rogers found himself after much desperate flailing of his arms, swinging
          rhythmically, if precariously with a frantically whistling Brian dangling from
          his bootlaces. Standing over them was a very proud and pleased-with itself
          purple people eater. He considered it a job well done. He'd had a good day.
          He'd come when he'd been called. And then, his new master had played a nice
          chase game. This was good fun. He looked down over the cliff edge at his new
          master in his shiny white suit.</P> 
        <P>"SHIT!"</P> 
        <P>The outcrop wobbled precariously as the purple eaters rear end
          landed smartly with the ground, tail wagging furiously. "I said <I>SHIT</I>,
          not <I>SIT</I>!!!" Ball shook his head as the anaesthetic began to clear his
          addled brain.<BR>"Back in the land of the living, then?" said Doctor Doug.
          "You've been out cold for hours."<BR>"How did you get out of the brig? Where am
          I?? "<BR>"I'll explain later. And where are you usually after you've been
          talking to the Captain?"<BR>"Point taken. Speaking of our esteemed commanding
          officer, erm, where is he?"<BR>"Oh he's just dealing with the end of season
          cliff-hanger..."</P>
