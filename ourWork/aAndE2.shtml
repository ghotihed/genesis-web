        <P>Captain's Log: Stardate My, god, my arms ache!</P> 
        <P>15:41</P> 
        <P>As I sit here on my comfy bean bag in my quarters on good old deck 36, the galley have reported a serious problem regarding the availability of shrimp, mackerel, herring and any small, oddly shaped aliens in luminous green Halloween costumes. And at the rate of consumption as it stands, we'll be feeding our newly found friend in cargo bay 6 red shirts by 1900 hours. Stuff the ship’s mascot, it's barbecued tonight.</P> 
        <P>19:12</P> 
        <P>The Cheese Federation have asked for a detailed report into our unscheduled visit to one of the Battersea Dogs Home’s more out of the way installations. Apparently they seem to be operating under the strange misapprehension that we work for them! What’s more, they seem to think they can tell us what to do! Still, I have vented my frustrations, and as a consequence we are now en route to pick up more personnel.</P> 
        <P>Still, here's the abridged version……</P> 
        <P>Apparently as it turns out, giant purple people eaters are marsupials and curiously, carry in their pouches a strange assortment of knotted sheets, rope ladders, snake charming devices and a Harry Houdini Tricks of the Trade survival kit. As a result, I’m happily sitting here, rubbing horse liniment into a seriously aching shoulder and eating a large, strangely coloured beef burger of dubious origin. The down side to this, is that the chef has informed me that this will have to be the main diet of the crew for the next seventeen years. Still it could be worse, at least we haven't got Ronald McDonald. </P> 
        <P>&lt;Cue: Tacky Sixties Music&gt;</P> 
        <P>Ball exited the turbo lift, hed already scanned to make sure the Captain wasn’t about. One of the rules aboard ship was that no-one but the captain is allowed to strut in zero-gravity. But the coast was clear, as was the bridge. So Ball set off in his most mincing manner and assessed crew status at all the ship's stations. Something was odd. He tried to put his finger on it. He walked around the bridge again, studying all of the readouts, images, scanners, and Daily Sport crosswords, still something wasn’t right. And it wasn’t just two-down. He walked back behind the Captain’s chair, lent his hands on the tacky sixties black plastic. He breathed in deeply, and then at the top of his voice screamed…….</P> 
        <P>"WAKEY, WAKEY!!!!"</P> 
        <P>Doctor Doug rubbed his chin.</P> 
        <P>"I've never seen the like. Are you sure there wasn't anything in the porridge?"</P> 
        <P>"You're supposed to be a man of science, a graduate of our highest medical accolades, and all you can suggest is the porridge?"</P> 
        <P>"Well, mine did look a funny colour this morning."</P> 
        <P>"Are you sitting there, paralysed, eyes bulging, rigid, completely immobile, and incapable of any sound or sign of life?"</P> 
        <P>"No, but I'm not watching <i>Voyager</i>."</P> 
        <P>Ball's thumb trembled with fear as he pressed the intercom button. And simultaneously crossed himself with his other hand. </P> 
        <P>"Er……Captain?"</P> 
        <P>"Yes, Ball, what do you want?"</P> 
        <P>"Er……we've got a bit of a problem, sir."</P> 
        <P>"What do you mean, a bit of a problem?"</P> 
        <P>"Well, it’’s the crew, sir."</P> 
        <P>"Never mind that, the writers assured me that this was going to be one of those 'the lead character doesn’t have to be in every episode', type episodes. So you’ll just have to make do."</P> 
        <P>"But, sir, you can’t have a sabbatical episode, it's the first one of season two! You left it on a cliff-hanger! There's people out there don't know if you're alive or dead! Can you imagine the mailbag the office is going to get if you don’t put in an appearance?"</P> 
        <P>"Well, when there was still doubt about us getting renewed, then OK. But now we've signed on, stuff 'em! I'm going fishing! For fifty years!"</P> 
        <P>(Well, we promised you the abridged <i>Key to Time</i>, now you’ve got it!)</P> 
        <P>Ball stared at the loud-speaker on the console in front of him. All that emanated now was high-volume static. He pondered the last time the Captain had left the ship, in search of anything animal-based, and wondered if he should order the ship's engineer to start building a water-proof tank in the hold. </P> 
        <P>……..The two writers looked at each other.</P> 
        <P>"Put the kettle on, we could be here some time……"</P> 
        <P>Sometime after chocolate biscuits, Doctor Doug (yes, folks we’ve finally thought of something else) picked up a small mallet, the type usually used for tapping under the knee to test reflexes. The knee had given absolutely no results, neither had hitting someone square between the eyes. He tried this on several individuals, all with the same in-effect. Doug looked up.</P> 
        <P>"Pass that big needle, would you?"</P> 
        <P>"Which one?"</P> 
        <P>"The big one, you know, the horse hypodermic."</P> 
        <P>"You get some funny cases on Deck 36, don't you?" said Ball.</P> 
        <P>"You don't know the half of it, we had Dobbin from Rentaghost in last week. It was murder."</P> 
        <P>"Is he still in Equity?"</P> 
        <P>"Sort of. The head is, but the backside expired two years ago".</P> 
        <P>"Don't tell the writers, or they'll go on stri——"</P> 
        <P>(Well this is season two, hence budget cuts and writers strikes. Next the'’ll be a really nasty American voice-over at the start).</P> 
        <P>Some time later, after lengthy legal negotiations, under-handed bribes in brown paper bags at several Little Chef service station laybys, and several packets of chocolate hob-nobs……</P> 
        <P>Doc Brown couldn’t believe his eyes. </P> 
        <P>"Great Scott! And he never moved a muscle! Einstein, did you see that? An eight-inch needle straight in the back-side! That's got to smart!"</P> 
        <P>"That's nothing," said Doug. "Just watch this!"</P> 
        <P>He lifted a transfixed Brian up to eye level. (We're not quite sure what a transfixed tribble looks like, but you'll just have to use your imagination).</P>
        <p>Doug gave it a hearty swing, and the needle entered full depth, entering just below one of the facial features he didn't have. Instantly, Brian went shooting across the bridge in mid-air, deflating like a balloon on steroids and making a sound like a seventies Whoopie cushion (or Captain Rogers after a big curry).</p>
<p>"Ah."</p>
<p>Doug quickly moved on to the next patient. He stared at George's face.</p>
<p>"I'll bet you wish it was still panto season, don’t you?" The blank expression stared back at him, despite the hypodermic needle being wedged between his eyes, and the mallet bruising around the temples. Ball had been studying doctor Doug's bedside techniques with care. But nurse Gladys hadn’t liked him watching so he’d had to leave. At least now he knew why people didn’t go to sick-bay unless it was really necessary. But as the Captain wasn’t around at the moment, his services really weren’t necessary.</p>
<p>The writers looked at one another. </p>
<p>"I've seen more believable scripts on CSI".</p>
<p>"Yes, but that was before we were renewed on the shopping channel"</p>
<p>"By the way, did you see that amazing brick-sharpening thorax toner in the last commercial break? I thought the latex lining and silk under-garments were a lovely touch".</p>
<p>Back on the bridge, it was a hive of activity. The <i>Frazer</i> had obtained geo-synchronous orbit above Planet CanonFodderForTheMasses, and a new influx of keen, attentive, and downright annoying Red Shirts were boarding the ship by shuttle (because of the danger of transporter accidents). Brown had set Einstein the task of finding as many parts of Brian as he could. He figured with a role of duct tape and a bicycle pump, anything was possible. (Well, if you can go back in time by pedalling a push-bike the wrong way, there’s got to be hope for a tribble in multi-part kit format). And Doug was busying himself arranging the mummified remains of the <i>Frazer</i>'s bridge crew into alphabetical order. He discovered that this way he could create an almost-in-key Xylophone (He was testing my spelling, and I won!)</p>
<p>Ball was in the Captain’s ready-room sobbing. </p>
<p>"You OK in there?" said Doug, peering through the door.</p>
<p>"He’ll kill me!"</p>
<p>"Who?"</p>
<p>"Who do you think?"</p>
<p>"Why would he want to do that?"</p>
<p>Ball raised an eyebrow at such a silly question. </p>
<p>"See this?" said Ball, waving a piece of paper in the air. "Orders, for him. The Cheese Federation are fed up with supplying Red Shirts. Apparently, the widows pension fund is in almost as much trouble as the national health service. They want him, and I quote 'to take extreme care with regards to the safety of all crew persons under your command'".</p>
<p>"And?"</p>
<p>"I'm the one who's got to give it to him!"</p>
<p>"I'll book you an appointment for when he gets back from fishing."</p>
<p>Rogers walked on to the bridge and his jaw dropped. As did the two red-shirted crewmen who had the bare-faced cheek to smile at him.
A shrill two-tone whistling sound could be heard followed by a far too keen young man in a nice crisp red shiny uniform shouting "Captain on……" &lt;THWACK&gt;</p>
<p><font size="-2">The effects budget has taken its first hit!</font></p>
<p>"Where the hell is everyone?!" Rogers stammered, as he made his way over to the only face he recognised. </p>
<p>"Didn’t you go fishing?" questioned Doug.</p>
<p>"I intended to, but some damned stupid idiotic horses arse who can't be bothered to pay his Equity fees has resulted in all the drivers going on strike. And there’s only so much fun you can have with a brick-sharpening torso toner! Anyway, I asked you where everyone was".</p>
<p>"Well, we’ve had a spot of trouble".</p>
<p>"What do you mean, a spot of trouble? Where is everyone?!"</p>
<p>"It may just be easier to show you." Doug led the captain to a door in the wall of the bridge, labelled "Caretaker".(More of that later in the season).</p>
<p>The door swung open, and Rogers gazed at his crew, all placed very neatly at the far end of the cupboard, stacked up like un-used chairs at a Genesis meeting. If it hadn’t been for the fact that they all looked as if they were suffering from advanced rigor mortis, they could have been mistaken for being active participants on deck 36.</p>
<p>"What on earth happened?"</p>
<p>"Apparently, Doug erred for a moment, someone tuned the viewscreen to <i>SeaQuest DSV</i> <FONT size="-2">starting Saturday, 1900 EST on QVC</FONT>"</p>
<p>"Is it permanent?"</p>
<p>"Well they only made one season, didn’t they, so I guess in six months or so they’ll replace it with <i>Relic Hunter</i> or something."</p>
<p>"No, you idiot!  I meant them!"</p>
<p>"Oh, sorry.  Well, only time will tell, but it could have been worse, it could have been <i>Voyager</i>"</p>

        <P>Captain's Log: Stardate Gladys Emmanuel in Stiletto Heels  (but don't tell Doctor Doug)</P>
        <p>QVC had a shopping extravaganza last month, so we have  undergone an extensive refit.  We have  now been re-stocked with some of the leftovers, including a storage bay full of  squeegees, a sink plunger with the motto "my other racehorse wears a colostomy  bag" and 4,682 A1 posters of Thora Hurd on a Stannah Stairlift.  In addition, we have recruited a  token-Russian crewman, Ensign Trotsky, who has been spotted selling dodgy  jewellery out of a suitcase just outside shuttlebay 3.  Shortly after, he was apprehended by a  security crew, who caught him spraying a shuttlecraft yellow and adapting it to  run on only three engines.  What a  plonkski…</p>
        <p>&lt;Cue: Tacski sixties music&gt;</p>
        <p>First officer Ball looked up from  his instrument panel, and smashed his head on the overhanging sound boom.  <br>
  "CUT!  Reset sound stage!" <br>
  "REALLY! I'M AN ART-EEST!  An act-or! I   didn't have this trouble at the Globe you know, especially not during  the Scottish play! Really! Try and get it right next time!  You're ruining my muse!  I must say, I don't know how Stewart stood it  all those years!"<br>
  "When you're quite finished being  a big girl, can we get on?  They're using  the studio for a live auction in two hours!"<br>
  "I say, there's no need to be  common….!"</p>
        <p>&lt;Take 2&gt;</p>
        <p>First officer Ball looked up from  his instrument panel, and smashed his head on the overhanging sound boom.  </p>
        <p>&lt;Take 3&gt;</p>
        <p>See above…..</p>
        <p>&lt;Take  4&gt;</p>
        <p>Ball walked out of the  turbo-lift.  Or at least he would have  done if they'd remembered to open the doors….<br>
  "&amp;@"!!^%!*@^**$@%""!!!!!!@(%)*"</p>
        <p>&lt;Take 5&gt;</p>
        <p>Ball stood perfectly still on the bridge.  Rogers eyed his first officer with a sideways  glance, his eyes moved downward from Ball's nose, all the way down to his shiny  boots.  <br>
  "What's the matter with you?   Are you having a brown trouser day?   Because if you are, I've got some bicycle clips you can borrow.  I got them on the grand auction on QVC.  Got my initials on and everything.  Don't tell Brown, but I've got two pairs for  Einstein for his birthday."<br>
          Rogers strode forward and looked over Maureen's shoulder,  and pretended to be inspecting the readouts on the desk in front of her, whilst  actually staring down at her ample bosom.     As he was doing so a thought suddenly occurred to him.  He wandered back to the other side of the  console, leaned over and whispered in George's ear "when did she get back?"<br>
  "Sir" said George, suddenly remembering he had some dialogue  to say. "The route passage to Galondon Core's central nexus McDoughnuts Burger  Bar is set and logged in the Nav-Com. Preparing for TWA—"<br>
  "HOLD IT! <font size="+1">HOLD IT!</font>  <font size="+2">THIS IS A BUST!</font>"</p>
        <p>Rogers turned towards the voice behind him, pointed at  Maureen and said "No!  <b><i>That's</i></b><b> </b>a bust!"</p>
        <p>&lt;Cue: commercial break, while the writers run for the  back door, via putting the kettle on and trying to work out what the hell to  write next&gt;</p>
        <p>"What? No biscuits?"<br>
  "OK, chocolate digestives good enough?"<br>
  "Re-arrange into sentence of your choice : Catholic.  Pope. The. Is."</p>
        <p>&lt;Cue: Fourteen twenty five second adverts of Lynn  Faulds-Wood using domestic cleaning products and then calling them "a potential  death-trap"&gt;<br>
          <font size="-2">(We  must be on Men And Motors this week)</font></p>
        <p>Right, best get back to the ploot…sorry plot.</p>
        <p>When the writers returned from the commercial break, ie, the  sandwich van in the car park, a strange sight lay before them.  The entire cast and crew arms outstretched  with their palms on the wall, feet apart, and an Oozy Nine-Millimetre pressed  into one ear-hole.  On the other end of  each gun was a control freak with black combat fatigues, bad language, and the  letters LACPD emblazoned in bright yellow letters across the back. ………………….the  number two writer on A &amp; E (name removed to protect the guilty) dropped his  prawn baguette and sloshed coffee all over his companion's suede loafers .  He slowly turned his neck to gaze at the  muzzle pressed into the pit of his back.  <br>
  "I didn't think our last episode was <i>that</i> bad!" <br>
  "We did. And so did the mob at Redemption.  Now shut up and get over there."</p>
        <p>Maureen found herself in a strange, dark room.  She could tell there were other people in  there, she could hear their voices.  But  the glaring table lamp shining directly in her eyes prevented her from seeing  anything and threatened to melt her implants.  <br>
  "I said, what do you remember of Episode Seven?!"<br>
  "Was that the one with the French people?  I thought that was rather good…."<br>
  "NO!  That was  episode  five! <br>
  "Well it could have been the one with that nice man from the  Ministry of Cheese, but I'm not sure.   Did it have big monsters in?  Was  I in it?  And if so did my bum look big  in the uniform?"<br>
  "We're wasting our time here.  She obviously spends far too much time on  Deck 36."<br>
  "Get her out of here! <font size="+1">NEXT!</font>"</p>
        <p>"For the record, what's your name?"<br>
  "RUFF!"<br>
  "Eh?"<br>
  "Rrruff, Ruff, Rrufff."<br>
          The inspector's assistant looked up from his notepad.  "Is that one F or two?"<br>
  "I'll tell you what it 'F-ing' well is! A bloody joke,  that's what!"<br>
          (No, this is A and E, we don't have jokes!) <br>
  &ldquo<font size="+2">;NEXT!</font>"</p>
        <p>"Doctor Doug, if you can please tear yourself away from the  nurse and answer the question!"<br>
  "Did It come after six?"<br>
  "You know perfectly well it didn't!"<br>
  "Well, was it before eight then?"<br>
  "Are you trying to be funny?"<br>
          (I thought we'd already established, this is A &amp; E, we  don't do jokes!)<br>
  "So, what <b><i>do</i></b> you know about episode seven?"<br>
  "There was a rumour about it being leaked onto the internet,  just prior to the series launch, but I was too busy with Nurse Gladys to pay  much attention."<br>
  "I think we're getting somewhere, Lewis".<br>
          He tweaked the angle-poise lamp slightly to keep up with  Doug's fidgeting. "So what else.  There's  got to be more".<br>
  "All I know is one minute I'm rehearsing a lengthy smooch on  the sickbay set, next minute guns are everywhere, people are rushing round with  flashlights and Nurse Gladys Emmanuel is being ordered to do my zipper back up.  Next thing I'm here answering your stupid questions about something that  doesn't exist!"<br>
  "Did you take all that down, Lewis?"<br>
  "Apparently not as much as Nurse Gladys Sir"</p>
        <p>&lt;Cue: scraping of gutter sound effect&gt;<br>
          (Careful,  we don't want to blow the budget.)<br>
  "<font size="+2">NEXT!</font>"</p>
        <p>"George Tacky, you've been playing the helmsman for, how  long now?"<br>
  "Since the crewman in the original pilot had an unexpected  accident with a hostess trolley and fourteen lint-balls while appearing as an  extra on <i>ER".</i><br>
  "And I suppose you know nothing about Episode Seven either?"<br>
  "Is that the one with the fish slice, the artichoke and the  chamber maid?"<br>
  "OK, quit the jokes (how many more times have we got to tell  them?) Where's Episode Seven?!"<br>
  "Look, I don't know anything, I was away at pantomime  rehearsal, I never even saw the script for episode six!  And I think I was in that one!"<br>
  "Yes, it showed as well.   Now what can you tell us about 'Conventions and Leaks'?"<br>
  "Considering the amount of beer that gets consumed at those  things, I wouldn't be surprised!"<br>
  "<font size="+2">NEXT!</font>"</p>
        <p>A Red Shirt walked nervously towards the chair and sat down  in the blinding light.<br>
  "Name?"<br>
  "Noname. Ensign Noname"<br>
  <b>&lt;<font size="+1">BANG!!!</font>&gt;</b></p>
        <h2>"<font size="+2">NEXT!</font>"</h2>
        <p>Lewis groaned as he heaved the body of Ensign No Dialogue In  This Episode onto the top of the steadily rising red shirt pile.  <br>
  "<font size="+2">NEXT!</font>"</p>
        <p>"I really must protest at this brutality!  Lawrence Olivier never had to put up with  this sort of thing!  Oh, there was a  lovie alright! I worked with him once in the West End, you know, frightfully  nice fellow, likes cats.  Anyway, Equity  will be hearing about this, you can count on it, they know how to treat an  act-OR, none of this roughian business… "<br>
  "Stick to the script, please, they've just brought in the  auctioneers gavel, and they're not afraid to use it!"<br>
  "So Episode Seven, then?"<br>
  "I've worked with Dicky Attenborough as well, you know.  Played MacBeth, King Lear, and all you care  about is a STUPID television program!"<br>
  "We're the <b><font size="+1">LACPD</font></b>, the Los Angeles Continuity Police  Department, we're <b><font size="+1">SUPPOSED</font></b> to care about stupid television programs,  even when they feature stuff bought on QVC!   Now start talking, and start talking <b><font size="+1">NOW!</font></b>"<br>
  "Eh?"<br>
  "The episode after number six?  Ring any bells?"<br>
  "Have you ever read any of these scripts?  All that ever happens is I hear bells!  I also normally wake up with a mild  concussion.  Which is probably why I  don't remember episode seven!"<br>
  "You getting this down Lewis?"<br>
  "Yes, sir, but how do you spell 'Attenborough?'"</p>

  "And you're chosen specialist subject is…..EPISODE SEVEN!"<br>
  "The one after six and before eight, am I right? Well I said  I was a know-it-all".<br>
  "We are a comedian, aren't we?"<br>
          (They're really not listening, are they?)<br>
  "Look, we know you know it, we know you leaked it.  Let's face it, you even advertised it on  eBay!"<br>
  "Well, a girl's gotta make a living, and no-one was buying  my <i>Voyager</i> tapes!"<br>
  "Bad language will get you nowhere!"<br>
  "Could you tip that light down a bit, I'm trying to do my  nails."<br>
  "No, Lewis I couldn't.   And I don't think the purple spandex was a good idea either. So what  else can you tell us?"<br>
  "Well, I think that nice young man from <i>ER</i> was in  it.  You know the one, facial scarring  and a heavy drug dependence., but apparently he's very nice to his mum."<br>
  "Could you narrow it down a bit?"<br>
  "Haemorrhoids?"<br>

  "Never mind that.   Brown, let me put it this way.   Are you going to tell us where Episode seven is or not?  Did you erase it?"<br>
  "Great Scott! How dare you?   That's a serious allegation to make!   Trust me, there's no way, absolutely no way that anyone on this show  with a rolling contract is gonna do anything to upset the boat! They'll kill  you off as quick as look at you.  Last  time I upset the director they deprived Einstein of Bonios for three  weeks!  He was in such a state he turned  up on Animal Hospital! Which reminds me, have you ever noticed how much Rolf  Harris looks like Rula Lenska on a bad day?!"<br>
          (Throw enough punctuation and some of it has to stick)<br>
  "But is it theoretically possible?  After all Episode four featured time travel".<br>
  "Well, strictly in theory, there's three possible ways.  One, you could channel one point twenty one  gig watts of electricity into the flux capacitor, thereby reversing the  polarity of the neutron phase and overwriting the temporal reality we know to  exist and project it to a far flung parallel universe, and replacing it with  something completely opposite in radioactive decay.  Two, Einstein could pedal backwards, really  fast while being shown an explicit copy of French Poodle Monthly, or thirdly,  they could have put the wrong tap in when they recorded Seaquest"<br>
  "Don't you know what DSV stands for? "<br>
  "Dispersion Sensory Variables?"<br>
  "My brain hurts.  You  keeping up with this?"<br>

  "Well that's plausible I suppose, but quite what you're  mothers got to do with it I really don't know.   Lewis, why are you shaking?"<br>
  "It's just the thought of what he did with the loo brush and  the fresh halibut.  It quite makes my  skin crawl." <br>
  "You know, Lewis, it's incredible, we've talked to almost  every principle cast member, and the only information we've got so far is from  a fluffy ball with bad spelling."</p>

  "Tell us what you know".<br>
  "Rrrussian was first man in space.  We were there farrr ahead of western  capitalist pigs.  The Big Macski was the  first burger invented, by poor Siberian farmer in 1438, but was nickedski by  thieving American pigdog pirates."<br>
  "This could take some time, lets try a different angle.  Name?"<br>
  "My name?"<br>
  "No my name!"<br>
  "I do not know you're name!"<br>
  "You play games with me mister, and you're through!"<br>
  "I am?  May I go now?"<br>
  "Next thing you'll be telling me you were looking for  'nuclear wessels!"<br>
  "Nyet!  We brave  Rrrussians invented nuclear wessels!   During the Cossak rebellion of 1642!"<br>
  "Please sir?  Can I do  it this time sir?"<br>

        <p>"Right, sit down, shut up, and stop hitting me!"<br>
  "Look, it's in black and white in my contract, the Captain  has to hit someone in every episode.  I  can show you if you like!"<br>
  "Are you going to tell us anything?"<br>
  "I can tell you lots of things.  For example, Ball's blood type is A negative,  I have a fish called Cyril, my birthday is every night on deck 36 and I have a  Willie Rushton LP from 1974.  Anything  else you'd like to know?"<br>
  "Apart from the Willie Rushton LP, do you have any other  criminal records?"<br>
  "Was that supposed to be a joke?"  (If it was, aren't they forgetting  something?)<br>
  "Look, you're the principle cast member.  You must have been in it.  You must have read a script for it.  You must have eaten in the canteen half way through  filming it.  So WHERE'S EPISODE SEVEN?" <font size="-2">(I shall say  zis only 477 times)</font><br>
  "Well I'm sure I was in it.   I remember having my hair done and everything.  Let me see if I can remember what  happens.  Erm….I definitely hit stuff,  then I hit some more stuff, then I shot something, which was probably red, then  I got to play with polystyrene rocks, then I probably shot something again, and  it's a fairly safe bet that I punched Ball.   Come to think of it, are you sure this episode isn't just hiding in  amongst all the other ones?  Either that  or it's fallen down the back of the sofa.   Lewis, have we met before?"<br>
  "So what you're saying is that you really have no idea about  this episode whatsoever".<br>
  "At last, reason dawns! Why don't you ask the guys who wrote  the bloody thing?!"<br>
  "Erm…..</p>

          Two wanna' be hoodlums in blue denim were pushed through the  doorway, and shoved into the waiting seats.   Somebody had been kind enough to find a second angle poise lamp,  although in ten minutes it was due to be auctioned off, and Lewis moistened the  tip of his pencil, which is easier said than done in purple spandex.<br>
          <font size="-1">(We're  gonna need a bigger shovel)</font><br>
  "Do you admit to writing this drivel?"<br>
  "Not in public."<br>
  "But you do write it?"<br>
  "Not in public."<br>
  "Have you ever worn purple spandex?"<br>
  "Not in public."<br>
  "Are you listening to this Lewis?"<br>
  "They seem to have got strangely repetitive sir"<br>
  "There's nothing strange about that, you obviously haven't  ever read this drivel before."<br>
          ……………………, writer number one on A &amp; E (name removed to  protect the guilty), sank deeper into his seat.<br>
  "Well, that's all they ever did in <i>Voyager!"</i><br>
          He exclaimed.<br>
  "Lewis, have you a loaded weapon in your holster?"<br>
  "Bit personal, isn't it sir?"<br>
  "It's not like I asked you if you've got any lead in your  pencil! Now just give it to me, man!"<br>
  "What here sir?   In  public!!!"<br>
  "Just give us the damn gun.   I'm gonna find out what this guy knows if it kills him!"<br>
          Beads of sweat poured from their brows, as they watched the  gun wave randomly between the two of them.   Their eyes were fixed on the barrel, like a snake gazing at a charmers  flute.  <br>
  "I said, WHAT HAPPENED TO EPISODE SEVEN, <font size="+1">NOW TALK DAMMIT</font>!"<br>

    <P>Captain's Log:   Stardate: 20 minutes later than intended because we've been watching  Paxman versus Kennedy, the well-known BBC comedy drama.  But mainly comedy.</P>
    <p>The Ministry of Cheese, Edam Special <i>Emissary</i>, has  been inspecting the staff canteen on the <i>Lower Decks</i> this week.  As a result, cases of food poisoning came  down 44.6%.  However, he made the mistake  of criticising the chef's effeminate vocal mannerisms and found himself being  served up as a major ingredient in last night's soufflé (I knew he wasn't going  to be able to spell it right first time).   All of a sudden food poisoning has shot up 78.82%.  Not exactly my idea of vital statistics but  you can't argue with a man with a chopper.   Thankfully that was on the plate next to mine. (Oh, God, it's started  already). </p>
    <p>On a personnel note, I'm getting a bit worried about Ensign  Trotsky. He refuses to Ba<i>The Naked, No W</i>ay is that good for the look of  a uniform!  </p>
    <p>I've been re-reading season one, and Stanley Rubik has a lot  to answer for.  And <i>I, Borg </i>isn't  the only <i>Legacy</i> that's been leaving me with <i>Night Terrors</i>.  <i>The Host </i>of images that can be  conjured up in <i>The Mind's Eye</i> when you think of him, a bucket of elastic  bands, fourteen slices of red lester, an industrial vat of KY jelly, a <i>Ship  in a Bottle</i> and the current <i>Cost of Living</i>.  Honestly it's a wonder I can walk  straight.  May be deck 36 has a lot to  answer for as well….</p>

    <p>George was on his hands and knees, he was on the  bridge.  If the captain had been on his  hands and knees, he'd definitely have been on deck 36.  <br>
 <font size="-2"> "Do  we get paid for writing this?"<br>
  "Last  month we got shot for it!"</font><br>
  "How's it go-sking down there?" Enquired Trotsky.<br>
      George ignored him as he continued <i>The Battle</i> with  the cover panels at the base of his console.<br>
  "I can't see it anywhere.   Are you sure it was here you last saw it?"<br>
  "Of course, I'm sure, you stupidski American pig-dog!  You're <i>Looking for Par'Mach</i> <i>in all  the Wrong Places</i>"<br>
      George's head spun round at the verbal retort and he crashed  his head against the metal plating.  He  ran his fingers through his hair and winced in pain as blood oozed over his  fingers.  <br>
  "MAN DOWN! MAN DOWN! MEDICS!"<br>
  <i>The Caretaker, </i>Mr Bennett, wandered past on his way  to the broom cupboard.  <br>
  "Oh, that must have hurt.   That's gotta be worth <i>A Night In Sick-Bay</i>!"<br>
  "All this 'cause you've lost your damned hamster.  Why didn't you keep the bloody thing in <i>The  Cage?!"</i></p>
    <p><font size="-2">"If  you thought the first season was a <i>Year of Hell</i> then this has got to be <i>Year  of Hell </i>part 2<i>!"</i><br>
  "Still,  in <i>Retrospect,</i> best not <i>Drone. </i>It'd be<i> Too Short</i> a <i>Season </i>to stop now so better write down a few more <i>Random Thoughts</i> before  we all shuffle off this <i>Mortal Coil</i>." <br>
  "So  that's how we're gonna do this is it?<br>
  "Well  can you think of another way of getting in episodes like <i>Menage A Troi"</i><br>
      What  else do you expect of Next Gen writers, I mean some of their  titles ,like <i>The Nth Degree, </i>or <i>Darmok,</i> don't even use real words!<br>
  &lt;Alternate  voice from the sidelines&gt; Oi <i>Pen Pals</i>, <i>The Arsenal Of Freedom</i> of speech, doesn't extend that far. If your not careful you'll be having a <i>Future  Imperfect, </i>and this will end up being your<i> Final Mission!</i></font></p>
    <p>Ball was desperate.   Dyno Rod were late again.  He  stood, <i>A Man Alone,</i> clutching his crotch in agony.  This usually happened after a swift kick from  the captain, but today it was Paula Radcliffe syndrome.  He was in desperate need of a <i>Force of  Nature. </i> He obviously had the  runs.  <i>Hard Time</i>s called for <i>Extreme  Measures</i> and <i>Extreme Risk</i>s<i>. </i>There was no alternative.  He bolted for the ladies room door screaming  "I'm going <i>Where No Man has Gone Before!"</i></p>
    <p>Recast Maureen, the only bridge officer with the looks of an <i>Angel (One </i>should never trust one's first impressions!) spied the first  officer and decided to spring <i>The Man Trap</i>.  She yelled at the top of her lungs: "Just be  careful <i>What You Leave Behind</i>!"</p>
    <p>Rogers looked at his itinerary for the day.  The listings were full of meetings,  schedules, deadlines, dead red shirts, and hitting people.  One name sprang out, mainly because Rogers  completely failed to recognise it.  <br>
  "Who's Charlie Ten?"<br>
      Yeoman Red-Skirt peered over his shoulder.  <br>
  "I think you'll find that's <i>Charlie X</i>, Sir, I think  he's a new crew replacement for the security section.".<br>
  "I don't care, it's a bloody stupid name, have him shot,  preferably at <i>Dawn</i>!"<br>
  "You can't do that, sir!"<br>
      Rogers gave her a look that expressed exactly what he  thought at that moment.  He always got <i>His  Way.</i><br>
  "I'll see to it right away, sir."<br>
  "Very good, I'll be relaxing on deck 36, it's <i>The Naked  Time</i>!  I'm due some <i>Invasive  Procedures </i>on deck 36."</p>
    <p>Back on the bridge, George had resumed his place at the  controls, when all of a sudden, <i>The Ship </i>came to a  <i>Dead Stop. Shockwave</i>s rocked the  bridge, and then came <i>Shockwave Part 2</i>.   George looked up, shaking his head.  <br>
  "Well, that was <i>Unexpected</i>" he said, his hand still  quivering over the control buttons.  <br>
      Trotsky glared at the read-outs in front of George.  He read them out slowly.<br>
  "<i>11001001,</i> what stupid pig-dog Americanski switched  zis to binary mode?!"<br>
      McAfee picked herself up on her hands and knees.<br>
  "I have to muck things up now and again.  It's what's known as <i>Datelore</i>.  It's amazing what you can do with a bit of  AOL software!"</p>
    <p>Down on Deck 8, Ball staggered from the ladies loos.  He looked at all the male crew-members that  had been thrown from their place whilst waiting for the one working gents  toilet.  <br>
  "If I were you, I'd <i>Hide and Q</i>ueue!"<br>
  "Eh?"<br>
  "Really, I never got this response from Guilegood! When we  played together at <i>The Royale</i> in <i>Time Square, d</i>irectors, and  act-ors both marvelled at <i>The Bonding </i>we shared, just look at the people  I'm forced to work with here! Really, it's quite enough to send me into an  institution. Still I can always look back at my days touring France with dear  old Johnny, <i>We'll Always Have Paris</i>."<br>
      All of a sudden a strange whining, groaning sound filled the  air, and Maureen wrinkled her nose.<br>
  "<i>Tacking Into The Wind</i> a bit there, aren't we sir,  never mind, <i>When It Rains</i>, it pours!"<br>
  "Never mind that, didn't you hear that noise?"<br>
  "Yes, to what <i>Emanations</i> did you think I was  referring to, if not your backside's persistent <i>State of Flux</i>? It was  only as <i>Loud As A Whisper </i>but you know what they say,<i> Where Silence  Has Lease</i>, get ready for the stinky ones!" <br>
  "Really!  I could be  in the theatre! I don't have to listen to this abuse!"</p>
    <p><font size="-2">"Get  on with it!  You can't have <i>The Best  of Both worlds!"</i></font></p>
    <p>Both Ball and Maureen (The ship's <i>Silicone Avatar)</i> stared dumb-struck as a weirdly dressed little man in a paisley scarf, panama  hat and cheesy grin peered around the corner of the corridor. The strange <i>Symbiosis </i>of elaborate garments gave the impression a man that had taken a month to  select his clothes, which was a pity as it looked like he'd then put them on in  about twelve seconds.  <br>
  "Hello! <i>Remember Me? </i>Oh, aren't I silly!  You haven't seen me since my <i>Regeneration</i>!  I'm <i>The Seventh</i>! Damn glad  to be rid of that stupid coat, even though Dave's mum had to knit me this  pullover!"<br>
  "What are you talking about?   I've never met you before in my life!"<br>
  "You sure?  Wasn't  your father <i>The Outrageous Okona?"  </i><br>
  "No!"<br>
  <i> Tuvix</i>?"<br>
  "No! <i>Sarek</i>!"<br>
  "Ah! That would explain it!  <i>Sins of the Father</i> and all that! So you'll be <i>The Offspring</i>!  It's all <i>A Matter of Perspective, </i>really,  probably all a <i>Conspiracy</i>!   Something to do with the <i>Coming of Age</i> no doubt."<br>
  "What are you blathering on about?" erupted Maureen.  "Actually, who the hell are you?  And <i>Turnabout,</i> <i>Intruder</i> alert!" she screamed into the intercom on the wall.<br>
  "I'm the Doctor!   Pleased to meet you!"<br>
  "<i>Doctor Bashir, I Presume</i>?"<br>
  "Eh? Never heard of him!   Is he one of the <i>Sons of Mogh</i>?   Nice man, met him once, at a fete, you know…"<br>
  "You've never heard of <i>Our Man Bashir</i>?!"<br>
  "No, but we all have our <i>Trials and Tribble-ations</i> to  bear."<br>
      <br>
  <font size="-2">"We've  just hit the three page <i>Threshold!"</i><br>
  <i>"</i>That'll be the <i>Crossover</i> episode then."</font></p>
    <p>"<i>Who Watches the Watchers?</i>" the Doctor mumbled to  himself, as he stared out <i>Through the Looking Glass</i> of the observation  deck, a <i>Haven</i> of peace and quiet, at the stars as they streaked  past..  He looked around the room once  more.  He wasn't used to being made to wait,  and there wasn't enough inspiration in the room to do his intellect <i>Justice</i>.  A strange sensation brushed past his ankles,  and he bent down to stroke the cat, which was purring feverishly at his feet.<br>
  "Hello, little chap", he said, bending down to inspect the  name tag on it's collar. "Skwee<i>Q,</i> <i>Who</i> do you belong to, I  wonder?"<br>
      As if in answer to his question, the cat, who'd obviously  decided the Doctor was not to be trusted, sank his teeth into the S<i>kin of  Evil</i>.<br>
  "You BASTARD! I'll skin you for that you little runt!"</p>
    <p><font size="-2">"Was  that one in V<i>oyager </i>or was it <i>Enterprise?"</i></font></p>
    <p>The cat had obviously decided he was vastly superior to some  random wandering Time Lord, and as if to prove it, Skwee<i>Q Pid</i>dled  against a plant pot, managing to damage the plant in the process, and then  buggered off.<br>
  "Oh well, <i>When The Bough Breaks</i>" mumbled the Doctor,  as the room's doors slid open.</p>
    <p><font size="-2">"OK,  let's put <i>TNG </i>down for a while".<br>
  "I  think it would be kinder to put <i>Enterprise</i> down, actually…."<br>
  "Actually,  so did UPN."<br>
  "By  the way, have you any idea how to squeeze <i>The Dauphin</i> into a sentence?"<br>
  "Not  unless the English language goes under some radical <i>Evolution."</i><br>
  &lt;Alternative  voice from the side lines&gt; Hey unless you two want to become<i> The Enemy</i> of the readership, can I recommend you quit with all the spurious <i>Transfigurations</i>,  ortake upsome alternative <i>Hollow Pursuits</i>!"<br>
  "I  say, cheers to the <i>Perfect Mate</i>, as <i>Imaginary Friend</i>s go you  could give <i>Lessons </i>in writing<i> Tapestty</i>'s of random <i>Schisms."</i><br>
  "Bugger"<br>
  "Now,  now, <i>Aquiel, </i>remember your <i>Ethics.</i> Now how about we stop this <i>Power  Play</i> for leadership of <i>The</i> <i>Masterpiece Society, </i>and get back  to <i>The</i> <i>First Duty </i>of business. After all we<i> Relics</i> need to  get to grips with <i>The Next Phase</i> of the plot.<i> "</i></font><br>
    </p>
    <p>"Have you got a <i>Death Wish?" </i>erupted Rogers, as he strode  onto the Observation deck.  "<i>Time and  Again</i> people come on to my ship, without being asked. So you're <i>The Visitor</i>? Who are you, and what do you want!"<br>
  "Wrong series I'm  afraid.."<br>
  "<i>Tinker, Tenor, Doctor, Spy</i>?"<br>
  "And people accuse  me of talking in <i>Riddles</i>".<br>
  "Tell me who you  are, now!  I've got a gun and I'm not  scared to use it!"<br>
  "Well, if you put  it like that, I'm the Doctor", he said, doffing his panama.<br>
  "Doctor?  What sort of Doctor?"<br>
  "Just the Doctor."<br>
  "Just what I need.  Another idiot with a <i>Hippocratic  Oath!"</i><br>
  "I'm not that sort of doctor", he said <i>Defiant</i>ly.<br>
  "Some ruddy member of <i>The Bar Association</i>, then?"<br>
  "I have <i>Allegiance</i> to no such thing.  I'm merely a humble traveller".<br>
  "Yeah, with a bloody great blue box  and you've got an <i>Alter Ego</i> to match,  which is currently blocking the turbo lift to deck 36, meaning I had to go <i>Up  the Long Ladder </i>to get here to see you, and will need to go back down <i>The  Chute</i> when I need to get back to deck 36.   ".<br>
      Rogers was really getting frustrated.  You could tell because his Phase pistol was  smoking, and most of his security escort had been caught in the <i>Crossfire</i>.  He'd got carried away with <i>The Muse </i>this time, and <i>Body Parts</i> and <i>Shattered Mirror</i> shards filled the room.   The <i>Frazer</i> was fast <i>Becoming</i> the <i>Barge of the Dead</i>.  The Doctor dared lift his head to search for <i>Lifesigns, </i>through <i>The Cloud </i> of fizzing  phaser fire.  <br>
  "<i>Cease Fire</i>! Haven't you ever heard of <i>The Rules  of Engagement</i>?!"<br>
  "You must be kidding! I haven't even heard of <i>The Rules  of Acquisition!"</i><br>
      The Captain looked round at <i>The Survivors.</i><br>
  "<i>Ensign", Ro</i>gers blurted. "Get a mop, will you?"<br>
      The Doctor looked round at the splattered corpses.  <br>
  "What the bloody hell did you do that for?"<br>
  "Well it was their own fault.  I mean, fancy having the colour red <i>For  the Uniform".  </i>Rogers always took  pride in his work.  "You got to admit,  I'm good!  I could shoot through <i>The  Eye of the Needle</i> with this thing!"<br>
  "Quite possibly," retorted the Doctor, "but personally, I  tend to prefer a bit more <i>Scientific Method</i> in my <i>Waking Moments</i> as opposed to the <i>Hunter</i>'s instinct, you seem to show.  <i>The Gift </i>of life is a very precious  thing, not to be simply thrown away in the manner of <i>The Killing Game</i> that you've just <i>Demon</i>strated, and to which I feel utter <i>Revulsion, </i>and  to which you show an unhealthy <i>Obsession.</i>.  I <i>Prey</i> I never come across you on a  dark night, that's all I can say".<br>
      The intercom buzzed by Rogers left ear, and manic sounding  George could be heard screaming from the loudspeaker.  <br>
  "Rogers here, what's all the kafuffle about?"<br>
  "They're everywhere, Captain!"<br>
  "OK, first of all, who's 'They'? And where's 'everywhere?"<br>
  "Excuse me" mooted the Doctor, "I'd just like to say, that's  the first time anyone's ever said that in front of me, and not been asking me  the question!"<br>
  "Sorry, Captain, I couldn't quite make that out", said  George through the intercom.  <br>
  "Take no notice, it was just my personal <i>Nemesis</i>.  What's happening up there?"<br>
  "Loads of ships, sir!   They came from nowhere! There was nothing on screen when I checked <i>Before,  and After,</i> <i>The Swarm</i> was everywhere!"<br>
  "Hang on, I'll be right there!" blurted Rogers.  He stared at the Doctor, in the way that only  Rogers could stare, and was most astounded when the Doctor managed to stare  back, without finding himself in a pool of his own blood, a look of divine <i>Innocence</i> on his face.<br>
  "We'll continue this <i>Duet</i> later, I have to see to the <i>Civil Defence</i>!"<br>
      Rogers stepped out the turbo lift into the comparative <i>Sanctuary</i> of the bridge.  The sight that confronted  him would have been a strange one, on any other vessel.  But on the F<i>razer</i> it was quite common  to find the entire bridge crew a pack of nervous jabbering wrecks throwing up  and hiding behind consoles, some of which had exploded for no apparent  reason.  <br>
      A calm voice drew the captain's attention. <br>
  "I think you're heading on <i>Course: Oblivion</i>,  captain."<br>
  "What do you mean 'oblivion?"<br>
  "You've entered the <i>Arena¸</i> Captain.  This is <i>Sacred Ground</i>. They're  preparing the <i>Warhead</i> as we speak, and this isn't some popgun, it's <i>The  Doomsday Machine</i>!.  I don't think you  realise the G<i>ravity</i> of the situation, although they do say ignorance is <i>Bliss</i>.  <br>
  "What are you trying to tell me?"<br>
  "You see that swirly, cloudy techno-babylon field  thing?  It's <i>The Breach, </i>or as  it's better known,  <i>The Void </i>of <i>Coda, </i>named after a <i>Real Life</i> <i>Warlord , </i>who ruled this region of  space, along with his wife <i>The Bride of Chaotica</i>, or <i>Alice </i>to her  friends.  It's a <i>Timeless, Dark  Frontier</i>, filled with <i>Disease, Whispers, Extinction, Contagion,</i> and <i>Infinite  Regress</i> but you'll never see it, because you die at <i>11:59, </i>I know,  because I saw it <i>Thirty Days</i> from now".<br>
  "What do you mean, thirty days from now? "<br>
  "What can I say?  <i>Tomorrow  is Yesterday</i> and <i>Relativity</i> is a bitch!"<br>
      Rogers chin moved, but no words came out.  <br>
  "That isn't going to help, especially as it's  five-to-twelve.  I see the <i>Apocalypse  Rising.</i>"</p>
    <p><font size="-2">"Actually,  it's five to ten!"<br>
  "NO!  The last two hours went in three and a half  minutes! This must be <i>The Voyager Conspiracy</i>!"<br>
  "Actually  I think we must be in a time <i>Vortex!"</i><br>
  "OK,  strike that off, it's <i>DS9, </i>series one…"</font></p>
    <p>"This is <i>A Time to Stand </i>and be counted Captain, <i>A  Call to Arms</i> is beckoning.  <i>The  Magnificent Ferengi</i>, <i>The Xindi, The Jem'Hadar, </i>even the <i>Cardassians</i>,  all await your <i>Blood Oath</i> or the <i>Sacrifice of Angels</i> in your name.  But all of that won't matter because you've  only got two and a half minutes left".<br>
  "Sounds to me like <i>The Siege of AR-558, </i>we got out of  that one by serving up tea and biscuits." retorted Rogers.</p>
    <p>All of a sudden Brian, who was hiding under the captain's  chair, began to squeak violently.<br>
  <font size="-2">"<i>Inter  Arma Enim Silent Elges</i>".</font><br>
      The doctor fiddled in his ear. "could you repeat that old  bean, my <i>Babel</i> fish seems to have worked loose.  <br>
  <font size="-2">"vgqwjeugtgwehakjbdguliwdbvsdmhbejsfw,  ,"</font><br>
  "That's <i>The Trouble With Tribbles</i>!" said the Doctor  pointedly.  <br>
  "Have you any suggestions, Doctor?"<br>
  "Yes, use chocolate spread in bread and butter pudding, it's  really nice! <br>
  "A sensible suggestion, you idiot!"<br>
  "Well, <i>The Menagerie</i> have made their <i>Descent</i>.  The <i>Battle Lines </i>have been drawn.  They're about to begin their <i>Operation: Annihilate! </i>and you'll soon  going to get a <i>Taste of Armageddon</i>!   And as I know how good this ship is in a fight, I suggest you run away  as fast as you can, or as they say, <i>Live Fast and Prosper!"</i><br>
      At that moment, <i>One Little Ship </i>began to flank the <i>Frazer</i>.  Rogers gestured to the small vessel as it  moved effortlessly in it's <i>Waltz</i> across the potential <i>Field of Fire</i>.<br>
  "I suppose that'll be <i>The Menagerie, part 2". </i></p>
    <p><font size="-2">"At  this point we need a break in the proceedings as we take on a fresh supply of  brain food (chocolate biscuits) and try to think of a way of including the  episode <i>For the World is Hollow and I have Touched the Sky"</i><br>
      No  illegal substances were used in the making of this episode.<br>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The <i>Frazer </i>hurled through space.  The crew just hurled.<br>
      Fourteen ships of various guise streaked through space in  hot pursuit of the <i>Frazer, </i>trying to hunt the <i>Starship Down</i>.  Their <i>Peak Performance</i> wasn't even  being challenged, and their <i>Manhunt</i> would not last for long.  It really was a <i>Captive Pursuit</i>.  <br>
  "You've bought yourself an hour at most" the Doctor said in  his usual indignant fashion.  "<i>Equilibrium</i> is always restored.  <i>The Search</i> will never stop, not even at the end of <i>The Search </i>part 2.  <i>The Collaborator</i>s are way faster than  you are Captain, they're <i>Playing God</i> with you.  <i>The Die is </i>Cast as they say, and no  amount of <i>Shadow Play</i> will halt <i>The Rivals</i> <i>Armageddon Game</i>.  <i>The Alternate, Necessary Evil </i>may be  to hide in <i>The Neutral Zone"</i><br>
  "The Cheese Federation doesn't have a neutral zone".<br>
  "You know what they say, <i>The Measure of a Man</i> when  looking into <i>The Changing Face of Evil</i> is a completely screwed one."<br>
  "You're not helping very much, y'know"<br>
  "I never help, merely interfere!  Just consider me a kind Samaritan"<br>
  "No, consider yourself a <i>Samaritan Snare</i>d, someone  throw this jerk in the brig!"<br>
  "Oh, is Lethbridge-Stewart here?"<br>
  "If you don't shut up, I'll kill you <i>To The Death</i>!  Get this man out of here and clap him in  irons!"<br>
  "Ah, <i>Business As Usual </i>then!"<br>
  "Sir", said a red-faced Ball, who had been hiding  particularly well in the cleaner's cupboard. "Can I suggest a <i>Simple  Investigation</i> should easily be able to determine who <i>The Adversary </i>is  and what he's doing here.  After all, you  know what they say, <i>Let He Who Is Without Sin…"</i> <br>
  "OK, you can have <i>The Assignment</i>" said Rogers, as he  wiped the blood off his fist, and Ball attempted to clamber back to his feet,  whilst gripping his nose in pain, <br>
  "This is ridiculous!   I could have been at The Globe!   I'm an  act-or, not a punch  bag!  I need to be on the stage!  The play's the thing, wherein I'll catch <i>The  Conscience of the King</i>….!</p>
    <p><font size="-2">"God,  we love Google!"</font></p>
    <p>"I've reached the <i>Final Frontier, </i>you know?  I've got no <i>Undiscovered Country</i> in  this bloody business…There's no soul in this dialogue, no <i>Dramatis Personae</i>!  We, <i>The Forsaken</i> are stuck here, <i>Once  More Into The Breach</i>,  on this  pathetic excuse for a shopping channel at the <i>Errand</i> <i>of Mercy </i>that  is our <i>Paradise Lost</i>.  <i>The Dogs  of War </i>are chasing us <i>In Purgatory's Shadow, </i>andin <i>The  Darkness and the Light, Far beyond the Stars, </i> <i>Who Mourns for Morn?"</i></p>
    <p>"That'll  be someone wanting <i>The Best of Both Worlds</i>, part 2"</p>
    <p>Trotsky turned slowly to Ball, looked him in the eye and  said "Oh, shut up you tartski!"</p>
    <p><font size="-2">"Could  this really be day three writing this thing?"<br>
  "I'm  getting this terrible feeling of <i>Deja Q!"</i></font></p>
    <p>The Doctor walked casually along <i>The Abandoned</i> corridor.  He'd been out of the brig for  at least half an hour, the sonic screwdriver is a wonderful little plot device. </p>
    <p><font size="-2">The Sonic  Screwdriver (Pat.  Pending) available  soon from QVC (minus the flashing blue light).</font></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p> He stopped and stared  at the <i>Afterimage</i> of his face reflecting off the console monitor  embedded in the wall. <br>
      <i>"Mirror, Mirror" </i>he mused, as he poured over the  effect of his recent <i>Metamorphosis.</i> "Thy say beauty is in the <i>Eye of  the Beholder</i>.  If only people knew  how many <i>Masks</i> this <i>Firstborn</i> has had to wear, how many <i>Faces</i> I've gone through"<br>
      The Doctor felt <i>Suddenly Human</i>, but only half, and  only on his mother's side.  <br>
      He tugged at the small yellow fish in his ear.  "Ah, I see, they don't work very well when  they're dead, do they?  I must book  another <i>Journey to Babel</i>!"  His  brow wrinkled for a moment. "Actually, was it <i>Babel One</i> or Two, I can  never remember."<br>
      He mused on the events that had drawn him here.  Part of him longed for his <i>Home Soil,</i> yet he knew he could never go back on <i>The Big Goodbye</i> and make <i>The  Voyage Home</i>.  "That's me," he mused,  "destined to be always <i>The Outcast, </i>forever <i>Lonely Among Us</i>eless <i>Children  of Time.</i>"  <br>
  "Please identify yourself" a sultry voice enquired, and the  Doctor jumped at <i>The Sound of Her Voice.</i> <br>
  "And you're <i>The Ultimate Computer</i> I suppose? Should I  just call you 'Calculator' or are you known <i>By Any Other Name</i>?"<br>
  "I know who you are.   You're <i>The Darkling.</i>   You're <i>That Which Survives</i>, displaced from <i>Distant Origin.</i> You herald the <i>Rise</i> of the <i>Favourite Son</i> of the <i>False Profits</i>.  <i>All Our Yesterdays</i> <i>Progress</i> like a <i>Prophecy</i> towards <i>The Reckoning</i>, <i>The Inquisition</i>,  through <i>The Amok Time</i> only ever to be concluded at <i>Future's End</i>….or <i>Worst Case Scenario</i>, <i>Future's End, </i>part 2."<br>
  "And there was me thinking you were only programmed in BBC <i>Basics</i>."<br>
  "Excuse me! <i>Basics 2</i> if you don't mind!  I've been upgraded, you know!"<br>
      The Doctor detected <i>The Thaw</i> in her manor.  "I have both <i>Hope and Fear</i> but the  fact that the <i>Omega Directive</i> exists, is <i>Unforgettable</i>.  You, my dear <i>Think Tank</i>, may yet be  the only <i>Living Witness</i> to the second part of <i>The Killing Game</i>.  Things can change in the <i>Blink of an Eye</i>."<br>
  "Are you sure that shouldn't be <i>Wink of an Eye</i>?"<br>
  <i>The Empath</i> mused for a moment.  "No definitely a blink. At least I'll know  that when <i>The Fight </i> comes, and <i>Night</i> falls, leaving <i>Nothing Human</i> left alive,   they'll be <i>Someone to Watch Over Me."</i><br>
  "Possibly true", said the <i>Microcosm</i> of circuitry, but  there's one thing you're failing to <i>Remember</i>."<br>
  "And what would that be?"<br>
  "The cat's just pissed on your shoes".<br>
      The Doctor's eyes spun down to his feet, faster than <i>The  Galileo Seven</i> on <i>Mudd's Women</i>.   He was just in time to see the <i>Catspaw</i> claw it's way straight  through his trouser leg and straight into his <i>Second Skin</i>, <i>In The  Flesh.</i> "You little shit, I'll have you stuffed!" the Doctor ranted with <i>Fury</i>.  <br>
  "Quite the <i>Renaissance Man</i>, aren't we?" mooted the  sultry computerised voice. <br>
  <i>Flesh and  Blood</i> oozed down the Doctor's socks.  More <i>Flesh  and Blood</i> splattered against the wall as the Doctor's left foot engaged  rapidly with the cat's <i>Unimatrix Zero</i>.  </p>
    <p><font size="-2">"OK,  I've got to admit that was clever  use,  but I can't wait to see how you're gonna squeeze in <i>Unimatrix Zero, part 2!"</i><br>
      <i>"Treachery,  Faith and the Great River,</i> that's gonna be the challenge!"<br>
  "Oh,  god, somebody <i>Take Me Out to the Holosuite</i> and shoot me!"<br>
  "Would  that be a severe case of <i>Til Death Us Do Part</i>?"<br>
  "No,  more like <i>Bada-Bing, Bada-Bang</i>"<br>
  "You've  been reading last month's episode again?" <br>
  "Well  I've got to admit, that was a <i>Valiant</i> effort, but the <i>Statistical  Probability </i>of us actually managing to pull this one off is about as great  as managing to get <i>The Prodigal Daughter</i> to wear <i>The Emperor's New  Cloak </i>on her wedding day.  </p>
    <p>Alternate  Voice From the Sidelines:<br>
      <i>"Author,  Author</i>!  That's blatant cheating! "You're not supposed to be making this look like <i>Child's  Play!</i> Now get on with it you little <i>Rascals!"</i></p>

    <p>On the <i>Strange New World</i> of  <i>Terra Prime</i>, <i>Wrongs Darker Than  Death or Night</i> couldn't stop <i>Empok Nor</i> from going down in a <i>Blaze  of Glory</i> by singing <i>It's Only A Paper Moon</i> continually until <i>The</i> <i>Schizoid Man</i> cut off <i>The Icarus Factor</i> he kept in his long-johns.  Nut back on board the <i>Frazer</i> things weren't going quite so well…</p>
    <p><font size="-2">"Cut  that out or we'll sack the <i>Workforce</i>!   And yes I do mean both of them, parts one and two!"</font></p>
    <p>"Doc, what the hell's going on in engineering?!" screamed  Rogers into the intercom.<br>
  "Great Scott!  The <i>Drive</i> chains have come off Einstein's push bike!   We're dropping out of TWANG!"<br>
      Ball walked up to his captain.  "Well at least no-one can blame <i>Human  Error</i>!"<br>
      Roger's fist flew into the side of Ball's face.<br>
  "<i>Dax </i>dot weri punny!"<br>
  "Consider that a <i>Pre-emptive Strike!"</i><br>
      There was an <i>Emergence </i>of <i>Bloodlines</i> that ran  in <i>Parallels </i>down Ball's face. </p>
    <p><font size="-2">"That  wasn't very nice".<br>
  "Well  it took out another five episodes, so it was all <i>For the Cause</i>.."<br>
  "Make  that six."</font></p>
    <p>"Have I arrived in the middle of some <i>Family Business</i> between <i>The Begotten Soldiers of the Empire</i>? <i>Ties of Blood and Water </i>obviously  aren't as strong as they used to be," said the Doctor, taking <i>One Small </i>Step  though the turbolift door.  <i>Distant  Voices</i> could be heard making aghast expressions as they laid eyes on their <i>Second  Sight </i>of the Doctor that morning.  <br>
  "So you've <i>Rejoined</i> us, Doctor, <i>Vis a Vis</i>,  you're going to get in the way again.  I  suppose there's no point in asking how you've escaped from the brig, without  being lectured at for fourteen hours, so what are you like with a bicycle spanner?"<br>
  "Well I saw them use one on <i>Home Front </i>once.  Why?  What's the problem?"<br>
  "Well to quote Doc Brown, <i>By Inferno's Light, </i> we've got a <i>Broken Link</i>!"</p>
    <p><i>The Quickening</i> pace of the <i>Frazer's </i>pursuers  was at the forefront of Roger's mind., and was appealing heavily to his <i>Survival  Instinct.</i>  He'd have to forgive the  Doctor his <i>Indiscretion</i>s which annoyed him intensely, but then there  were <i>Facets</i> of the Doctor's character that annoyed everybody intensely,  as they say the <i>Ferengi Love Songs </i>but nobody loves a smart-arse!</p>
    <p>The <i>Frazer</i> was dead in space. <i>The Circle</i> of <i>Marauders </i>that surrounded the Cheese Federation's flagship <i>Juggernaut</i> continued to lay <i>The Siege</i>, and there was no hope on the <i>Horizon</i>.  <i>The Expanse</i> of ships had grown  extensively since the <i>Frazer's</i> <i>First Flight </i>when it left it's <i>Vanishing  Point</i> at the <i>Singularity Anomaly</i> they'd first discovered when most  of the ship's compliment had just sat down to watch <i>Carpenter Street </i>on <i>Meridian</i>. </p>
    <p>&lt;For reasons we'd best not go in to, at this point we had  a <i>Flashback</i> to the first season&gt; </p>
    <p>On the bridge of the <i>Frazer</i> the crew considered their <i>Future, Tense</i> fears filled the air.   All of a sudden, <i>The Communicator</i> shrieked into life. <br>
  "This is <i>Rajiin</i>!   You are in breach of your <i>Exile</i>.   Why have you crossed the <i>Borderland</i> and re-entered the <i>Chosen  Realm</i>?"  <br>
      Rogers gazed at the <i>Little Green Men</i> on the  screen.  He looked over at the Doctor. "I  though the ones with big heads and black eyes only came in <i>Shades of Gray</i>".<br>
  "It's a case of <i>Un-natural Selection</i>, I'm afraid",  retorted the Doctor.<br>
  <i>The Child </i>sized alien on the screen was beginning to  get impatient.  "<i>The Emissary </i>has  not stopped you and the <i>Countdown</i> to <i>Zero Hour</i> is nearly over.</p>
    <p><font size="-2">"Di-di,  di-di, di-di-didi, peowwwwwwwwww!" <br>
  "Richard  Whitely, eat your heart out."<br>
  "Would  that be <i>Heart of Stone</i>, by any chance?"<br>
  "No,  and it's not <i>Heart of Glory, </i>either".</font></p>
    <p>Rogers walked over to McAfee.  "Have we still got <i>The Shipment </i>in the  hold?" he enquired.<br>
  "What do you mean, sir?"<br>
  "You know, that <i>Precious  Cargo</i>, the one with the <i>Bounty </i>on it".<br>
  "What, the one in  cargo bay four?"<br>
  "That's the one,  alright.  Beam it into their ship, will  you."<br>
  "What, the entire  contents of the cargo bay?"<br>
  "The whole lot."<br>
  "But Trotsky's in  there, selling <i>Fair Trade</i> coffee off of the back of <i>Shuttlepod One! </i>Don't forget, he's the token Russian.   If you get him killed they'll be a <i>Tribunal</i>, possibly even a <i>Court Martial</i>!  It'll certainly involve  extensive <i>Shore Leave</i> and it won't be in the shape of <i>The Homecoming </i>you'd intended when you finally got your <i>Captain's Holiday</i>."<br>
      Trotsky (<i>The Defector)</i> found himself paying <i>The  Price</i> having tried to continue  with Ye<i>sterday's Enterprise</i> when he found himself being beamed straight  into the brig.  <i>The Loss </i>of <i>The Most Toys </i>he'd ever experienced in one go had happened  when the entire contents of the cargo bay had been beamed onto the alien  ship.  He swore <i>The Vengeance Factor</i> would be high.<br>
  "Zat <i>Devil's Due</i>ski a damsk good <i>First Contact</i>".  Inwardly he knew that such action would set  him beyond any hope of <i>Redemption</i>  and <i>Insurrection</i> in the ranks was very dimly thought of. He decided it was probably  better to have an <i>Identity Crisis</i> instead. <br>
  "Have you no idea  of the <i>Code of Honour?</i>" the Doctor enquired, as he stared at the  image before him on the bridge's display screen. <br>
  "<i>A Matter of Honour</i> is a relative thing", Rogers retorted as he  gazed with pride at the scene before him.   Even <i>The Ensigns of Command</i> deck had been impressed by the <i>Booby Trap</i>.</p>
    <p><font size="-2">"And we're impressed that getting that one in  didn't involve either Ensign Goodbody or Maureen!"<br>
  "Mind you, it's a shame, we could have clicked off <i>The Augments, Projections, Prime Factors, Cold Front, </i>even <i>What Are Little Girls Made of?"</i><br>
  "You've really got to stop before there's <i>Investigations".</i><br>
  "As long as there's no <i>Initiations</i>, we'll  be alright."<br>
  "How can you get those two words mixed up?"<br>
  "<i>I Mudd</i>le  up my words all the time! Still we really should make a <i>Resolution</i> to break this <i>Deadlock</i> and get back to the <i>Sprit Folk</i> aboard the USOS<i> Frazer</i>."<br>
  "There just aren't enough punishments in the  world!"<br>
  "Just wait 'til we write the episode about <i>The  Haunting of Deck 12</i>!"<br>
  "That's  it! You're out of <i>Lifeline</i>s!"</p>
    <p>&lt;GROAN!!!!&gt;</font></p>
    <p><i>The Wounded</i> lay strewn everywhere.  A few lucky ones still hung on to <i>Half a  Life</i>.  As the Doctor stared at the  view screen his thoughts became audible.  <br>
  "You'll never <i>Return to Redemption. </i>I hope you've got  a <i>Rightful </i>Heir to accept your <i>Inheritance</i>, because there'll  be  no <i>Second Chances</i>.There's  always <i>Cause and Effect</i>.  In all  of <i>Time's Arrow</i>, <i>I </i>have never seen <i>The Quality of Life</i> open to so many <i>Violations</i> by someone in a <i>Chain of Command</i>.  I haven't be so sickened since <i>Thine Own  Self</i> was forced to appear in <i>The Chase</i>!"<br>
  "It's <i>A Matter of Time</i> someone admitted how bloody  awful that <i>Conundrum</i> of a story was," piped up McAfee.</p>
    <p>On board the alien vessel, the <i>Disaster</i> was still  unfolding, and a <i>Realm of Fear</i> and utter panic had gripped the entire <i>Starship.  Mine</i>ral wealth  means very little when there's a giant purple  people eater called <i>Tin Man</i> ripping your <i>Brothers,</i> in fact your  entire <i>Family</i>, down to their constituent parts.  <i>The Hunted</i> aliens sought refuge in  every nook and cranny they could find, but nowhere could they escape the  lashing <i>Dragon's Teeth</i> or rending claws.  <br>
      Rogers laughed gleefully. "Look at 'em, <i>The Drumhead</i>s!"<br>
      The Doctor leaned over his left shoulder.  "You're going to hell in a hand-basket, and  there's no <i>Accession</i> or <i>Return to Grace</i> once you get down that  far.  That's hardly <i>The Way of the  Warrior</i>!"</p>
    <p><font size="-2">"Here,  do you realise we've only got to find a way of using <i>The Sword of Kahless</i> somewhere and we'd have done the whole of <i>Ds9</i> season four!"<br>
  "I  think it could be done, <i>In Theory, </i>and if we squeeze in <i>Elementary,  Dear Date</i>, and <i>The High Ground</i> we could chalk of <i>TNG </i>seasons  two and three as well!"<br>
  "With  links like that, we'll be inducing <i>Hero Worship</i>!"</font></p>
    <p>"Sir!" shouted George.   "Numerous vessels powering up!"<br>
  "How many?"<br>
  "Do you need any <i>Clues</i>?" mooted the Doctor, wryly.<br>
      At that moment every enemy vessel flared it's engines and  began to close on the <i>Frazer</i>.  <br>
  "<i>The Second Time's Arrow</i> brought me here, I knew I'd  get to see the <i>Face of the Enemy</i> before <i>The Game</i> concludes.  We're beyond <i>Unification</i>, in fact, the <i>Second Unification</i> became impossible as soon as you reached <i>New  Ground</i>s of stupidity.  I don't care  what sort of <i>Birthright</i> you think you've got, but you're still merely a <i>Man  of the People</i>."</p>
    <p><font size="-2">"Do  you think this character actually has a <i>Birthright to </i> finish the entirety of <i>TNG</i> for us?"<br>
  "Well  if we can get him to say <i>Descent part 2</i>, that'd really help!"</p>
    <p>&lt;You  really are <i>Twisted</i>, you know!   Look, we'll never get to <i>Journey's End</i> at this rate! They say <i>All  Good Things </i>must come to an end, but you've got to write the <i>Homeward </i>passages  first!"&gt;</font></p>
    <p>The <i>Sub Rosa</i> and <i>The</i> <i>Pegasus </i>led the  charge, moving faster than the <i>Phantasms</i> of <i>Terra Nova </i>when they  caused <i>The Andorian Incident</i>.</p>
    <p><font size="-2">"We're  an <i>Oasis</i> of discontinuity, you know!"<br>
  "I've  never seen the <i>Fascination </i>with it myself.<br>
  "Never  mind that, do you realise that this <i>Fusion</i> has taken more than <i>Two  Days and Two Night</i>?  And the <i>Minefield</i> hasn't finished yet!"<br>
  "You  realise my respected C<i>ogenitor</i> will never live down the <i>Stigma</i> we're gonna get for embarking on this <i>Stratagem".</i><br>
  "Just  wait for the <i>Stormfront</i> , I think we're in for a rude <i>Awakening</i>!"<br>
  "Especially as the <i>Stormfront  </i>will be in two parts".</font><br>
      Mr Bennett ventured out of his hiding place in the broom  cupboard, exposing <i>The Inner Light</i> that lay within. The very <i>Second  Chain of Command </i>was reduced to utter chaos as the first salvo of torpedoes <i>Interface</i>d with the ship's hull.   All crew members that weren't sent reeling by the violent explosions  were hiding behind consoles, chairs and each other. This, however, Bennett  didn't see because he was back hiding in his cupboard.<br>
      Lieutenant McAfee risked life and limb by crawling across  the bridge floor clutching <i>A</i> <i>Fistful of Datas</i>heets.  She made her way to the captain, who's  fingers had clenched so tightly they'd punched straight through the tacky  sixties plastic of his chair.  <i>True Q</i>uality  comes at a price, a price which was too high for the Cheese Federation.<br>
  "Captain! I may be able to help! I've discovered some <i>Data.</i> <i>S Day, </i>our battle strategist, thinks he's come up with a better way of <i>Breaking  The Ice</i>." <br>
  "We've got a battle strategist?!  On this tub of lard?!<br>
      Just then, another torpedo hit, and it was a real bone-"<i>Shakaar</i>"</p>

    <p><font size="-2">"That's it!   I'm not writing down one more bloody <i>TNG</i> episode titles!"<br>
  "That's OK.   We've done all of them, but what's the <i>Past Tense</i> of <i>Prophet Motive</i>?"<br>
  "<i>Past Tense </i>again?  I thought we'd already had that one!  You're gonna have to be a bit more of a <i>Visionary</i>".<br>
  "So it's not <i>In The Hands of  the Prophets</i>, then?"<br>
  "No, that would be the third person singular."</font></p>
    <p>The Doctor had a  headache so bad it felt like a <i>Dagger  of the Mind</i>.  <br>
  "God, I haven't  felt this bad since <i>The Return of  the Archons</i>!"<br>
      His eyes flickered,  then he realised he was staring at the fluorescent tubes of the sickbay  ceiling.<br>
  "My <i>Dear Doctor, </i>so nice of you to wake up", said Doctor Doug as he walked up to inspect  the computer readouts at the Doctor's bedside.   "You're off <i>Life Support</i>.   Good job for you you've got that second heart, I told that nurse Gladys  you'd pull through, no trouble, <i>The  Nag</i> <i>us</i>eless she is.  Still, she helps keep the hostess trolley  warm."<br>
  "Never mind  that!  The ship!  What happened to the ship!  There were explosions and everything!"  blurted the Doctor, scrambling to get out of bed.<br>
  "Oh no you don't!"  said Doug, "you're staying right there!  <i>Doctors Orders</i>!  I shouldn't let it worry  you.  All that excitement, it's not good  for the system.  Let <i>Sleeping Dogs</i> lie, I say.  Besides, you've  done me a favour.  I get to talk to you  in sickbay, so I get some dialogue to say.   I really need the wages since my night out at <i>The House of Quark</i>".<br>
      Out of the corner  of his eye, the Doctor saw <i>The  Catwalk</i> across the floor in front  of him with a mouse in his mouth.  <br>
  "Jesus Christ!" he  blurted.  "This is supposed to be a  medical centre and you allow that thing to wander about in here!  "It's very unhygienic you know.  I saw an <i>Equinox</i> about it  once.  Part 2 was particularly  interesting!"<br>
      With one swift  kick, Doug managed to make the cat drop <i>The Passenger</i> and <i>Move Along Home</i> much faster than it intended.   Skwee<i>Q-Less</i>  his  captive mouse-disappeared indignantly out the doorway.</p>
    <p>The Doctor had got  his way.  Somehow he always did.  He strode through the doors of the  observation lounge, the largest single room on board the <i>Frazer</i>.  There <i>The Gamesters of Triskelion </i>had assembled  for <i>A Piece of the Action.</i> <i>A Private Little War </i>was about to ensue.  The Doctor wasn't going to be held back. He  had an <i>Assignment: Earth</i> needed him-again.  For <i>The Omega, Glory</i> must be  achieved, even if he had to <i>Return  to Tomorrow </i>to achieve it.  </p>
    <p><font size="-2">"Have you seen the episode titles from the Original  Series?! How did the bastards think we were ever going to manage <i>Requiem for Methuseleh?"</i><br>
  "The same way as we're going to manage Elaan of  Troyius and <i>The City on the Edge of Forever</i>!"</p>
    <p>"I'<i>M</i> <i>Iri</i>sh "  The words came before the  Doctor had a chance to ask anything of the man who stood before him. "Shamus  Day's the name, pleased to make your acquaintance!"</font><br>
  "What's going  on?  Last I saw we were due to be dog  food".<br>
  "Ah.  Well, we didn't all escape in tact.  The computer's up the <i>Carbon Creek</i>, which is a shame because without her playing chess the <i>Harbinger</i>s of doom a<i>Bound</i>."<br>
  "I still don't  understand what on earth you're going on about".<br>
  "Well, we  challenged them you see, it was a case of <i>Fight or Flight</i>.  As we had a <i>Broken Bow</i> 'fight' wasn't  really an option.  So we challenged them  to a duel, their best game players against the best our crew can muster".<br>
  "On reflection, perhaps  'flight' might have been the better option".<br>
  "The amount of <i>Damage</i> we'd taken, we're damned lucky the <i>Demons</i> <i>United</i> and accepted our offer.  It's  lucky they don't know we haven't got any more purple people eaters, or they'd  never have signed up to it.!"<br>
  "This was done on <i>Impulse</i>, wasn't it?"</p>
    <p><font size="-2">"She is!"<br>
  "No, she isn't!"<br>
  "That was terrible."<br>
  "Yes, but not as terrible as <i>Who Mourns for Adeonis."</i><br>
  "Or <i>Spock's Brain</i> for that matter!"</font></p>
    <p>"So who's playing  chess if the computer's not up to it?"<br>
  "Well we tried  pulling out <i>The Apple</i>, but when <i>The Enemy Within</i> the ship  saw it, they laughed so much the whole <i>Balance of Terror</i> turned  quicker than <i>the Devil in the Dark</i> doing <i>The Corbormite Manoeuvre</i> <i>This Side of Paradise</i>   while being interviewed by Jeremy Paxman!"  </p>
    <p><font size="-2">"I'm sorry but this is desperation.".<br>
  "I'm sorry, but these are bloody stupid titles!"</font></p>
    <p>Around the room,  several different crew members had been assigned to various different  challenges.  Maureen was in the centre of  the room scratching her head trying to get an understanding of the game <i>E2</i>. A game from <i>Azati Prime</i> that <i>The Council</i> of war from  the <i>Kir'Shara</i> had brought with them.  She was trying to figure out how to play it,  it was showing a certain <i>Similitude</i> to <i>Canamar</i>.  Trouble is, she couldn't play that  either.  The game seemed to be based on  the old concept of the <i>Acquisition </i>of wealth, <i>Profit and Loss, </i>and building of <i>Civilisation</i>s, but if you landed on a certain square,  you were instantly detained in jail without getting 200 credits, and without  passing Go.  She was approaching a state  of near paranoid <i>Affliction</i> when the Doctor made <i>The Crossing</i> to her point in the room.  <i>The Changeling </i>staring down at her every move, which really didn't help.  This was unusual, as people normally stared  down at other things of Maureen's. Soon <i>The Squire of Gothos</i> proclaimed their first victory of <i>The  Day of the Dove</i>.  </p>
    <p><font size="-2">"I really hate the Original series now!"<br>
  " I really hated the first series then!"</font></p>
    <p>The vast majority  of the assembled alien menace seemed to be linked in some way.  The Doctor soon learned that in their culture <i>The Way to Eden</i> lay in achieving <i>The Mark of Gideon</i>, which could only be attained by  in-breeding with members of your own family, meaning that the entire  civilisation were actually<i> Generations </i>of <i>Plato's Stepchildren</i>.   This had led to several genetic problems, <i>The Paradise Syndrome </i>being  the most prominent and <i>The  Immunity Syndrome</i> producing the  most acne.  The Doctor imagined their  television adverts having the slogan '<i>And the Children Shall Lead</i> the way to the medicine cabinet'. The Doctor mused to himself "<i>Is There In truth, No Beauty</i>?  You  bet there bloody isn't!"<br>
      <i>The Savage Curtain</i> of  <i>Twilight </i> began to fall, as the alien <i>Space Seed</i> congregated around the few remaining game tables.  The scores were evenly matched until someone  wheeled out Warhammer, and then the aliens had spent hours playing  catch-up.  <i>The Tholian Web</i> was a game  George had found particularly stimulating to play. It used a board with strange  octagonal shaped  <i>Patterns Of Force </i>fields and <i>Repentance</i> of one's <i>Lineage,</i> that holographic <i>Explorers</i> had to try to overcome, with nothing more  than ingenuity and lightening reflexes.   Not to mention fanatical devotion to the pope.  By the time George was finished, he was <i>Shattered</i>, <i>Body and Soul.</i> The game utilised psychic <i>Repression </i>and any <i>Imperfection </i>on the part of the player bent the <i>Natural Law</i>s of physics, and <i>Critical  Care </i> was essential to prevent the <i>Inside Man</i> from being reduced to a small puddle of red goo, whether you were wearing  a shirt of that colour or not.  <br>
      All of the main  bridge crew were participating apart from the captain, who due to his unique  intellect had been sent to the corner of the room with a tin of Alphabeti  Spaghetti.  <i>The Alternative Fact,</i> <i>or </i>fiction, depending on your point of view, was that <i>The Deadly Years</i> and the <i>Spectre of the  Gun</i> had produced strain that was  beginning to show.  The Doctor walked  over and patted him lightly on the head.   "Fear not, for I am your <i>Good  Shepherd, Ashes to Ashes, </i>dust to  dust, and all that stuff, you need fear none of it.  You'll hear <i>Nighingale</i>s sing once  again back on your <i>Homestead…"</i></p>
    <p<font size="-2">>"I'm having a <i>Change of Heart </i> you know.  Maybe this wasn't such a smart idea  afterall…."<br>
  "*#$*@%….!!!!!"<br>
  "Just kidding…"</font></p>
    <p>Both Rogers and the  Doctor were stopped in mid track by the shrill bleating coming from somewhere <i>Behind the Lines</i> of crowded on-lookers.  <br>
  "I'd best go and  have a look" the Doctor said.  "<i>You're Cordially Invited</i> to come along if you like."  <br>
      Rogers was  undergoing something of a <i>Resurrection. </i>"No-one has to invite me anywhere  on my ship!  If you don't watch it, you  won't be Time's Champion, you'll be <i>Time's  Orphan</i>!!"<br>
      If anyone else's <i>Son's and Daughters</i> had come out with something as ridiculous  as that, <i>The Tears of the Prophets</i> would flow.   But <i>In the Pale Moonlight</i> of <i>Melora</i> where <i>Honour Amongst Thieves</i> still existed, no-one really cared about  pronouns or punctuation, so why should they on the <i>USOS Frazer</i>?  <br>
      Both Rogers and the  Doctor made their way towards the sound of Brian's shrill voice.  If anything it had gone up another two  octaves. Normally the only way something could change that much was with the  aid of a <i>Chrysalis</i>.  <br>
  "You're sounding  most upset Brian". </p>

  "We don't need to know, we've already got <i>The Voyage Home. </i>How about doing <i>The Search for  Spock</i> instead?"</font></p>
    <p>"Oh well done  Brian!  You've managed to beat him at  scrabble!" The alien's face showed a look of pure fury at the fact that Brian  had managed to achieve the word 'zoological' on the <i>Penumbra </i>of the board  utilising two double-letter and one triple word score.<br>
  "As they say, old  boy, fortunes <i>Favour the Bold</i>!"<br>
      With that <i>The Wrath of Khan</i> exploded into a verbal torrent as Brian's dejected foe stomped off in  a huff, leaving a very happy Brian free to sit back and enjoy the culmination  of the game of Cluedo on the neighbouring table, where security officer  Crabtree (remember him?) was trying to decide if the culprit was Deanna Troi in  Space dock with the <i>Enterprise,</i> or Q, everywhere, with everything.</p>
    <p><font size="-2">"What? There wasn't a single episode title in that  bit!  You didn't mention <i>The Marquis, , </i>or even it's sequel,<i> The Marquis part 2! </i>How are w<i>e </i> ever going  to cross <i>The Wire </i>if <i>The Storyteller isn't going to pull his finger out?  </i>So lets show some <i>Unity</i> and get this <i>Collective</i> work finished before Sunday really does get here!"</font></p>
    <p>Ball was playing a  very strange game.  His opponent <i>Vox Sola</i> had brought with him an odd computer game called <i>Rogue Planet</i>, where his challenge was to guide a <i>Fallen Hero</i> and his <i>Fortunate Son</i> through a <i>Desert  Crossing, </i>whilst following the <i>North Star</i> and avoiding the <i>Silent  Enemy</i>.  However things weren't quite going to  plan.  It was one of those old style  games, that would give you limited options, or ask you questions about what you  wanted to do, and as they were playing on a BBC 'B', it was running rather  slowly.  His current predicament was  whether to step <i>In a Mirror,  Darkly</i> concealed in one corner of  the view screen, or step <i>In a  Mirror, Darkly</i> concealed in  another part of the screen.  He opted for  the one in the top right hand corner, only to find that in the <i>Shadows of P'Jem</i> (the realm in which his characters were currently engaged) people jump  out with pointy sticks and kill you.  It  was turning out to be something of a <i>Proving  Ground</i> especially as Ball wasn't  doing anything about <i>The Forgotten</i> <i>Hatchery </i>of alien entities waiting around  the corner to bite his hero's goolies off.    But it could have been worse, he could have been playing Fizbin.<br>
      The <i>Observer Effect</i> of having the Doctor staring over his shoulder was not helping  matters, and all in all, he'd much rather have been at <i>Home</i> with a nice cup of cocoa, and the latest edition of  'Woman's Own'.<br>
      The Doctor knew  that <i>Judgement </i> was  the better part of valour, and approached his seat on the centre table with a  sense of apprehension.  He'd never lost,  not even to Evil from the dawn of time, but there was a first time for  everything.  But still, it was his  favourite thing, except maybe for <i>Bread  and Circuses</i>.  As he sat he noticed the seat of his chair  felt <i>Cold</i>. <i>Statione</i>ry   had been placed at the side of the chess board, to log the player's  moves, and a strange <i>Divergence</i> of alien entities had surrounded the table  to get a better view of the final showdown.  <i>The Aenar </i>were there in force.  <i>Daedalus,</i> <i>The  Forge</i>tful opponent that sat in the  opposing chair was desperately trying to remember <i>The 37 s</i>eparate move  restrictions available in 3-D chess, and was seriously thinking about having to <i>Tattoo </i>them to his forearm.  The <i>Prototype</i> of this plan had not gone well however, and the resulting mess looked  like a dose of the <i>Phage</i>.  He  was in for a steep <i>Learning Curve</i>, but not as steep a one  as he would have faced if he'd got a dose on  deck 36.<br>
  "Well", said the  Doctor, "what would you prefer, white or black?"  he held both hands out. Daedalus picked the  right one, and prepared to go first.</p>
    <p><font size="-2">"Hang on! We've had <i>Daedulus</i>  three times now!  That must mean we're owed at least one <i>Jetrel</i>, and maybe even a <i>Cathexis</i>!"<br>
  "You realise you could have taken the opportunity  to ask for <i>The Q and the Gray</i>?"<br>
  "Yeah, but I didn't think they'd go for it."    </font></p>
    <p>"Right" said the  alien.  "Let's see <i>Whom Gods Destroy!"</i><br>
  "Doctor, these are  very <i>Non Sequitar</i> moves you seem to be making" gestured  Maureen.  "Are you sure you haven't  undergone a mind <i>Meld</i> with Ball's BBC 'B'?"<br>
  "Don't worry my  dear, <i>Heroes and Demons</i> are seldom understood.  It's a <i>Parallax</i> really, the more  you know, the less people are prepared to believe your <i>Persistence of Vision</i>."<br>
      The Doctor continued  with his <i>Manoeuvres. </i> The  Doctor's adversary picked up a strange <i>Chimera</i> shaped playing  piece and as he moved it <i>Shadows  and Symbols</i> changed direction on  the computerised board.  Like an <i>Image in the Sand, </i> the  board perpetually changed and winning the game was as much about being in the  right place at the right time as it was about cunning and stratagem.  Some said it made <i>Parturition</i> seem like  child's play.  The Doctor's pieces began  to form a barrier of <i>Resistance </i>that no <i>Alliances </i>from his  opponent's pieces could penetrate.  Beads  of sweat dripped from the Doctor's brow, as if he was somehow a <i>Cold Fire</i>.  He picked up his <i>Dreadnaught</i> and in one move took his opponent's first and second <i>Scorpion</i>s.  <i>Blood Fever</i> was beginning  to show on Daedalus's face.  (That was  another common medical condition they often suffered from). His position was  beginning to be <i>Concerning</i>. <i>Flight</i> could soon prove to be his only  option.  <br>
  "How are we doing?"  asked Rogers, as he had no idea what game they were playing.<br>
      McAfee glanced at  her captain.  "Well, points wise, we're  hinged on a <i>Counterpoint.  </i>This  game is going to be the ultimate decider".<br>
  "A case of <i>One Small Step</i> for man, eh?"<br>
  "From what Doctor  Doug tells me, he's far from a man."<br>
  "I could have told  you that, just look at that noncey scarf!"<br>
      The Doctor's  fingers teased on the pure <i>Elogium</i> figurine in the centre of his lower  board.  <br>
  "<i>The Raven</i> to <i>Q2</i>", as he spoke the Doctor moved the avian  looking sculpture onto the left hand side of the middle board, just as it's  square shimmered red, indicating a potential check manoeuvre had been  completed, and the players had reached the <i>Endgame,</i> and then moved  through to it's second part.<br>
  <i>The Ascent</i> of the piece really put the game beyond  doubt.<br>
  "<i>Ex Post Facto</i> you might say", blurted the Doctor, as he released his grip on the  raven piece.  Lights on the board turned  gold, highlighting the colour of the Doctor's own pieces, and victory was  his.   </p>
    <p><font size="-2"><i>3-D chessboard  (Pat. Pending  )coming soon to QVC soon.</i></font></p>
    <p><font size="-2">"This product placement is really getting out of  control!"</font></p>
    <p><i>Rapture</i> filled the room, as Cheese Federation crew  members throughout the ship realised survival might yet be an option, provided  their captain wasn't too upset and they didn't bump into him in the too near  future.  <br>
      The Doctor was  exuberant.  "Victory is ours! Wi<i>N or the Battle to the Strong</i>. <i>Let  That Be Your Last battlefield</i>!"<br>
      He rose from his  seat with aristocratic <i>Motion.</i> <i>Picture </i>the scene, as Ball fearing someone  else was attempting to act, stepped up to the plate.<br>
  "My dear lovies,  they say it's all <i>In the Cards</i> but a <i>Covenant</i> has been made and  we have done our part.  <i>Things Past </i>are past.  Yet things future are  yet to be. They say <i>Friday's Child</i> is loving and giving, unlike a BAFTA with  no name plate.  And so I'd like to thank  my agent, my family, everyone who's been involved in my long and illustrious  career, including, of course, <i>The  Cloudminders….."</i></p>
    <p><font size="-2">"Ah! Bet you thought we wouldn't get that one in!</font></p>
    <p>"….and so with  heartfelt gratitude I say……."<br>
  "<i>Tsunkatse………</i>!" blurted out Trotsky as the violent  sneeze caught him and everyone else completely by surprise.  He'd been allowed out earlier for two  reasons.  Firstly, because they didn't  think in retrospect, <i>The Enterprise Incident</i> was really that severe, but  mainly because they thought they were all going to die anyway.  Goes to show you never can tell. That's <i>Destiny</i> for you.<br>
      Rogers suddenly began arguing vehemently with the leader of  the alien delegation.  All of a sudden he  threw out a fist and sent the hapless gray creature ten feet across the  floor.  The Doctor raced in to separate  before a brawl could erupt.<br>
  "What you do that for, Captain?  If  you fight like animals, you'll die like animals!" <br>
  "I bet him twenty quid, now he won't pay up           ! I told him, give me my <i>Profit  and Lace</i>rations can be avoided!"</p>
    <p><font size="-2">"Considering  it's 2am, we're both really impressed with that!"</font></p>
    <p>The observation deck was now almost clear, and the Doctor  looked in deep contemplation as he stared at the arboretum's water  feature.  He gazed at the water as it flowed  past the <i>Rocks and Shoals</i> of fish that were attempting to avoid the  littered beer cans and polystyrene cups that were strewn all over the  place.  It had been like one of those  office style Christmas parties that no-one wants to clean up after.  But the Doctor was always the one doing the  clearing up. <br>
  "If <i>Paradise</i> is ever to be maintained" he said, "You  should read your own <i>Memorial </i>plaque.   It may only list ensigns with red shirts but they're important to the  Universe".<br>
      The Doctor's <i>Nemesis</i> was ignoring him.  He didn't like speeches.  Actually he didn't like anything.  And he especially didn't like the guy  standing in front of him at that particular time.  <br>
  "You'll be glad to see the back of me, won't you." said the  Doctor.  "Your <i>Day of Honour</i> will  come".<br>
      And with that, he dropped the <i>Message in a Bottle</i> he'd  been holding into the water feature.   With that, the paper inside instantly turned to mush, and blocked up the  entire filtration system.  <br>
  "It's a <i>Fair Haven</i> you have here, Captain", he said, gesturing to the ship around  him.  "It's a <i>Pathfinder</i> for the whole  Cheese Federation of mankind.  But tell  me, where'd you put my blue box?"<br>
      Trotsky spent hours  scrubbing the paint from the side of the bizarre-looking blue box which was  still blocking the turbo-lift to deck 36.   If he ever found out who'd scrawled Big Bad <i>Wolf in the Fold</i> all down  one side, in white spray paint, he swore he'd kill 'em.  <br>
      He looked on as <i>The Lights of Zetar</i>diski began to flash and the strange whining  noise began to echo through the corridor.   All of a sudden everyone looked suspiciously at Ball.  <br>
  "If that smells,  I'm gonna hit you!" growled the Captain.<br>
      The <i>Latent Image</i> of the old police box vanished into thin air.  <br>
  "That was a true <i>Friendship. One</i> I'll never forget". <br>
  "Don't be stupid  Ball.  You haven't got any friends, never  have!" Rogers may be cruel, but he's never kind.<br>
  "Oh, well, I  suppose as <i>First Contact</i>s go, that wasn't too bad".</p>
    <p align="right">&lt;Cue: Tacky Sixties Music&gt;</p>

  <P>Captain's Log:   Stardate The Hottest Day of the BLOODY YEAR.</P>
  <p>The ship's been suffering from a major inconvenience, and  for a change it's nothing to do with Dynorod.   Every cargo bay is stacked full to overflowing with unwanted Franklin  Mint 3-D chess sets since the last episode.   As a result, no-one can get to the sunglasses, sun-tan lotion or KY  jelly.  Needless to say, Doctor Doug is  in a rather foul mood and Deck 36 has had to be shut down for the duration. QVC  are threatening to have us cancelled, and the hose has split on the  Acqua-Vac.  </p>
  <p>It must be Tuesday.   Never got the hang of Tuesdays.</p>

  "Well, it's not my fault!"<br>
  "Well, who's is it then?   Accounts? Marketing? Catering-?" <br>
  "Catering?!  You mean  that burger van in the car park?!"<br>
  "--International launderette service? Ross??!" the producer  frantically waved the audit bill for the last episode in the face of Writer  Number Two. <br>
  "Look at these bloody numbers!  Honestly! With this sort of money per episode  we could be funding some high-brow programming!   Button moon doesn't cost much more than this!" <br>
  "Well what do you expect me to do about it?"<br>
  "Right, well this episode had better include forty-four advert  breaks, and no effects budget."<br>
  "So no change there then".<br>
    Max Savings, the show's producer, stomped off in the  direction of his favourite urinal with a rolled up copy of Exchange and Mart  under one arm, and QVC's summer sale catalogue in his back pocket.<br>
  "So, we cancelled, then?" enquired Writer Number One as he  came back with his breakfast. (that's coffee).  <br>
  "No, we're OK, no-one's sued us yet".  <br>
  "Well, we'll see what we can do about that.  Time the company lawyers had a brown trouser  day.  You get the type-writer, I'll get  the A to Z and the German phrase book!"</p>
  <p>"…Oh please can we get on with it?  Shakespeare didn't take this long to write  bloody Hamlet!"<br>
  "Look, Rogers, just start, do your stuff, and we'll just  fill in the blanks as we go along".</p>
  <p>If there was one thing Captain Rogers could do well, it was  faking it.  But another thing he did very  well was laying people out cold with one punch.   (If only he'd done that to the Doctor at the start of the last episode,  it would have saved them thousands!)   Rogers stared down at the crumpled blooded first officer as he squirmed  on the deck.  "That do to get you going?"  he quizzed, giving a wry grin to the two writers before turning on a heel,  picking up something heavy and chasing two extras in red shirts down a  corridor.  <br>
  "Do you think this could be the episode where the captain  goes berserk and rampages wildly around the ship?"<br>
  "That would be something novel, wouldn't it?"<br>
  "Maybe we need more coffee".</p>

  <p>Rogers gazed out at a very strange sight.  (Yes, folks, we ARE going to write something  which is plot-driven.  We're sorry to  disappoint you, we'll try not to take up too much of your valuable time, and we  promise we'll never do it again.   Actually we might, but don't tell anyone, 'cause no-one will ever find  out from the website…).</p>
  <p>"Get on with it!   We've got to fit in another forty-three commercial breaks yet! And if  anyone mentions Lynn Faulds-Wood, I'm gonna get out a yard broom and the  Alkazeltza!  You have been warned!"<br>
  "Sounds like a <i>potential death trap</i>!"<br>
  "Look, chaps, I've been gazing out at this strange sight for  ten minutes now.  Would you mind telling  me what I'm looking at, please?"</p>
  <p>&lt;pause&gt;</p>
  <p>&lt;silence&gt;</p>
  <p>"Oh, sorry, I thought you were still making stuff up".</p>
  <p>Rogers scratched his head, sat in his tacky sixties plastic  chair, pressed the communicator button on the left hand console, and in a very  unbecoming quiet voice whispered "Doc? You there?" <br>
  "Great Scot!  What can  I do for you captain?"<br>
  "What's got fourteen legs, fifty-eight claws, translucent  scales, and is surrounded by swirls of hundreds and thousands?"<br>
  "Oh my god it's my mother in law!"<br>
  "If it is, she's just eaten the night shift bridge crew".</p>
  <p>"CUT!!!!!"</p>
  <p>"Weren't you listening?!   They said NO SPECIAL EFFECTS!" <br>
  "Ah, I'm guessing we're going to have to loose the hundreds  and thousands, then".</p>
  <p>Meanwhile back on the bridge, Rogers slowly reached down for  his trusty Phase pistol. (replicas of which, complete with sounds effects and  flashing lights, and I'm told, detachable loin cloth, are available in QVCs  MONSTER summer sale – batteries not included-actually they're better than the  props in the show…)</p>
  <p>He raised the gun slowly to eye level, took careful aim,  pulled the trigger, and watched in horror as a stick flew out of the muzzle and  a flag unravelled with the word KAPOW!! emblazoned on it in bright red and  yellow lettering.  (We told you the toys  were better than the props, didn't we?) Incidentally, large selections of <i>Batman</i> memorabilia are available from the QVC auction hot line (probably).  <br>
  "SSSSSSSSHHHHHHHHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIITTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!"  screamed Rogers as he ran at full stretch down the corridor.  It was like doing the hurdles.  So far he'd successfully cleared a lioness (that  WAS Doc Brown's mother in law), two alligators, and a shark called Gerald (yes,  that's right, folks, we've 'jumped the shark!')   He turned the corner to see George, Ensign Trotski and Maureen cornered  by a mutant dinosaur with ostrich feet who showed an uncanny resemblance to  Lynn Faulds-Wood.  <br>
  "Ah, thankski Lennin!   Our brave American pig-dog captain is hereski to save us from the <i>potential  death-trapski</i>!"  To their horror,  they watched the captain run straight past then noticed he was actually being pursued  by half the inhabitants of the Masi Mara, several refugees from Jabba's palace,  and a large fish on a skateboard  (no pun  intended) (we don't do jokes, remember?) </p>
  <p>Voice from the sidelines:   "Lynn Faulds-Wood may not sue, but you can bet George Lucas will!"<br>
  "Don't worry, we're selling the action figures on QVC  Special Auction, Lucas gets the royalties!"<br>
  "So that's what you give the man who's got everything,  Prince Phillip!"<br>
  "More coffee over here, please!".</p>
  <p>The captain had rounded the next corridor and was confronted  by sixteen feet of towering metallic and diamond-encrusted robotic death, which  was at that moment, partnering a CGI Gene Kelly in a tap-dance duet, to music  played by Max Headroom and the Jeff Wayne Ensemble (available on Double CD or  cassette).  (That wiff of burning smell  you're getting about now is the budget department spontaneously combusting).</p>
  <p>"STTTTTOPPPPPPPPP!!!!" screamed Max Savings as he bundled  his way frantically through the cubicle door, pulling his trousers up as he moved  across the sound-stage faster than a speeding bullet with it's pants down.  "Where are we going to find the money for all  this?!  We've yet to sell any of those  damn chess sets, and the royalty bill has come in from the BBC for the Doctor  Who licence!  Get rid of these effects at  once!"<br>
    Writer Number Two took his fingers out of his ears.  "We can't take it out of the script, you're  interfering with our creative <i>Muse</i>!"<br>
  "Oh, no, not again, don't go there, please! That was <i>Yesterday's  Enterprise</i>!"<br>
    For some strange reason, Writer Number One suddenly had this  strange urge to cry.<br>
  "We've got to put a stop to this.  The budget is not just a thing in a red case,  you know"<br>
  "Look, we couldn't amend our script even if we wanted to,  the protesters have stolen the rubber off the end of my pencil".<br>
    Max turned, lifting his glasses.  There in the distance, beyond the sound stage  doors, marching triumphantly across the lot car park, waving their placards,  was the entire special effects division of QVC Daytime Television Enterprises,  or Light Industrial Magic, as they sometimes called themselves.  </p>
  <p>"WHAT DO WE WANT? SPECIAL EFFECTS! WHEN DO WE WANT THEM?  NOW!!" </p>
  <p>"WHAT DO WE WANT? SPECIAL EFFECTS! WHEN DO WE WANT THEM?  NOW!!"</p>
  <p>"WHAT DO WE WANT? SPECIAL EFFECTS! WHEN DO WE WANT THEM?  NOW!!"</p>
  <p>"WHAT DO WE WANT? SPECIAL EFFECTS! WHEN DO WE WANT THEM?  NOW!!"</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Max marched up to the front of the parading queue, who  walked straight over him, trampling him into the tarmac.  A groaning Max Savings slowly clawed himself  up onto his hands and knees.  This was a  very peculiar sight to see in the middle of the public car park.  A senior television producer, on his hands  and knees, with his trousers round his ankles, and a large queue of people  positioned behind him with huge phallic shaped wooden placards.  (Eurotrash, eat your heart out).</p>
  <p>Things were not going well on set.  Following heated debate, violence and  multiple-sackings, and more violence, Light Industrial Magic's contract was a  shredded mess in the waste bin, and Doc Brown was having serious trouble with  the idea of being strangled by a coat-hanger with a mop head on top if it,  dangling from a piece of fishing line.   On the bright side fourteen ambulance men, nine emergency room nurses  and a hysterical doctor had all been mustered to aid in the retrieval of a  novelty canoe paddle.  </p>
  <p>It's a real shame for Max Savings that no-one could reach  the KY Jelly.</p>
  <p>(No Red Shirts were harmed in the making of this episode)</p>
  <p>&lt;KAPOW!!!&gt;</p>
  <p>"Oh come on, surely we can afford just <i>one</i>, miserable  sound effect!"</p>
  <p>&lt;BANG!!&gt;</p>
  <p>(One Red Shirt was harmed in the making of this episode).</p>

    <P>Captains Log: (May contain Nuts!)</P>
    <p>Pandemonium has broken out aboard ship when the crew  discovered that the Bubble Gum machine had broken down and wouldn't be fixed  until the Cheese Federation have finished their official enquiry as to the  incident at Barrow in Furness bus depot woman's toilets.  <br>
      If that sounds bad, just imagine the current queue for the  gents!</p>
    <p>Due to the lack of bubble gum, several people came up with  the bright idea of spit-roasting Ensign Brian.   This only failed when they discovered that singed tribble hair is highly  toxic.  Although not as toxic as Britney  Spears, obviously.  Needless to say, we  now have another Dyno Rod situation on our hands.  I really should buy some shares.  </p>
    <p>                                                                                                &lt;Cue:Tacky  Sxties Music&gt;</p>
    <p>Back off planet Earth, the <i>Frazer</i> tumbled through  space. The bridge crew held on valiantly, as around them, chaos descended as  everything not bolted to a bulkhead – and quite a few things that were – were  sent flying through the air in random directions.  If anyone was going to be unfortunate it had  to be Ball.  (It's written in his  contract).  He caught a hole punch square  in the face  (are you sure that's not a <i>whole</i> punch?) and was sent screaming to the floor clutching his newly found third  nostril.  <br>
  "WHAT THE BLOODY HELL'S GOING ON??!!" screamed Rogers as he  lurched out of the turbo-lift doors.  <br>
  "Vell, Captain American   Pig-Dogski, ve seemski to be experiencing nietTWANGski!"<br>
  "Eh?  What's that  mean?"<br>
  "The TWANG, sir!" piped up George, from the helm. "It's out  of balance!"<br>
  "What do you mean, out of balance?"<br>
  "Didn't you see <i>The Motion Picture?!</i> " replied  George….</p>
    <p>&lt;Voice from the Sidelines:<br>
  "Not…going…there…ever….again!  EVER!"&gt;</p>
    <p>….as Trotski's chair was ripped from it's moorings, sending  the unfortunate Russian flying head-first into Maureen's lap.  <br>
  "What do you think this is?   Deck 36?!"<br>
  "Whrew yurv frumph fumf wereh" replied Trotski (muffled  Russian is not an easy language to master!)<br>
  "It's quite simple Captain!" hollered Maureen, above the  crescendo of falling debris and novelty paperweights.  "The TWANG is out of phase, though personally  I blame George – his eyes are too close together.  And as for you", she said, staring down at  Trotski, "I'll see you later, you naughty boy!"<br>
      Trotski smiled inwardly and grabbed a feel as he clambered  his way back to his console.  <br>
  "Brown! Brown, you there?   Come in!" hollered Rogers into the comlink on the arm of his tacky  sixties fake-leather effect plastic chair, which was now embedded in the main  viewscreen.  <br>
  "Id mide be desirer wid dis blugged din" stammered Ball, as  he dragged himself up onto one elbow and held aloft a handful of stripped and  scared cabling that had once adorned the internal construction of the captain's  chair.  Rogers gazed at Ball's  offering.  <br>
  "Smart arse!" pronounced Rogers, and he managed to kick Ball  in the face accidentally on purpose as he struggled to the communication  officer's station., brushed Brian out of the way, and stabbed at the big yellow  button.  Unfortunately, that just turned  off the <i><u>spqwll chkrer</u></i> (see?)   His thumb hit the red button, and he tried again.  <br>
  "Brown! You there?   Engineering, come in!"<br>
  "Hello a seductive female computer voice replied.  "please chose from one of the following  options" A list appeared on the screen in front of him.<br>
  "To speak to an engineer, press 1.  <br>
      To hear about QVC's current special offers on the latest  edition of Techno-Babble for Dummies, press 2. <br>
      To order our fabulous swimsuit issue, press 3.  <br>
      To leave a message for Einstein's fan club press 4. <br>
      For a private line to Ensign Goodbody, press anything you  like, repeatedly, provided it's in private and on deck 36. <br>
      For typing lessons, press 5, <br>
      To place a callout for Dyno Rod, press 6, and try not to do  it again.<br>
      Or if you're really desperate and can put up with it, press  7 to speak to Doc Brown".</p>
    <p>Rogers stabbed at the '3' key, four times, and then  reluctantly pressed '7'.<br>
  "I'm sorry, no-one is available at present, you're call is  important to us, please hold the line, one of our operatives will get to you as  soon as possible.<br>
      A horrible tinny noise reverberated through the  speakers.  The hold-music Doc had chosen  really was dreadful, and is available on a double CD from QVC's mega music  store.  Press 8 now to order your copy! <br>
      Eventually, an exasperated Rogers, clambered through the  doors to engineering.  It had been an  interesting turbo-lift ride to say the least, but at least it was a good excuse  to get a torn shirt and bash into fourteen lowly red-shirted crew-members.  Lucky for Rogers he always carried a pocket  knife for such eventualities.<br>
      He spotted Brown standing at a console – he knew it was him  because of the curiously askew colander balanced on his head and the Mr Fusion  kitchen devil tucked under his arm.<br>
  "What the hell are you doing fitting an automated phone  system down here?! And why are trying to wreak my ship?  That's the captain's job, and don't you  forget it!"<br>
  "Great Scott! Captain! What brings you all the way down  here?"<br>
  "The laws of gravity for a start, you idiot!"<br>
  "There's no need to go to any trouble, you could've just  called!"<br>
  "There's not enough time in this episode to go into that,  now what's wrong with the TWANG?!"<br>
  "Great Scott Captain! It's the shift phase compensating  variance flip magnet! It slipped sideways during full-pedal mode and has wedged  itself down the back of the sofa along with the remote control to the VCR!"<br>
  "Well, don't we have any spares?  Can't you make one out of a paperclip or  something?  Don't you watch MacGyver?!"<br>
  "The thing is, it <i>was</i> a paperclip, Captain!  Anyway, the variance in the flip magnet is  the only thing that was stopping the bio-syncratic wavelength fluctuation of  the gravimetrically opposed tortionised mono-fillimant motionising modulating…erm…modulator."<br>
  "Eh?!"<br>
  "The elastic band broke!"<br>
      Rogers flew into action.   He pulled out his Swiss Army knife, and sliced through the remaining  elastic band.  This had two immediate  effects.  Firstly, it brought the <i>Frazer </i>to level flight and a slow stop.   Secondly, it brought the elastic band rapidly round Doc Brown's  head.  He was only saved from being  mortally wound up by the elaborate wire-covered colander on his head, plus the  remaining months on his contract.  </p>
    <p>Einstein pined by Brown's sickbay bed-side as Rogers headed  back to the bridge, leaving his engineer to be fussed over by Nurse Gladys  (much to Doctor Doug's disgust) (and try saying that after fourteen Babychams  and a bucket of lager).  <br>
      On the bridge, the crew were huddled around George's  console, staring in incomprehension at the A to Z. <br>
  "I tell you, we should have turned left at the Little Chef!"<br>
  "Call yourself a navigator?" retorted Maureen.  "I wouldn't trust you to find a novelty  paperweight in a QVC warehouse!"<br>
      Rogers took in this  view for several moments.  He didn't have  many alternatives seeing as his chair was still embedded in the  viewscreen.  <br>
  "You're gonna tell me there's a problem, aren't you?" <br>
  "Wesa people gonna dieski", uttered Trotski, starring into  his Captain's eyes.<br>
      Maureen frantically stared at the read-outs, scratched her  head, and called for the science officer.  <br>
  "You don't want that oaf!" laughed Rogers.<br>
  "Well, you tell me what that big swirly cloudy thing is in  the rear-view mirror, then!"<br>
      Rogers stared at the display.<br>
  "Oh shit!  Last time I  saw something like that, the annoying little git with the umbrella turned up!"<br>
  "Zat's because ze cheapskateski American pig-dogskis are  re-using the effect!" snarled Trotski.<br>
  "They're entitled to, they did invent them!"<br>
  "Vot are you talking aboutski?  Everybody knows zey ver invwented by  Rrrussian peasant in 1748ski!"<br>
  "Never mind that!   Besides the show can't afford royalties since the git with the umbrella  turned up! Now if you've quite finished will someone tell me what that bloody  thing is?"<br>
  "Well, I've never been so insulted in all my life!  If only I'd got that job at the Globe! They  know how to treat a budding thespian there!   They even had dressing rooms you know! But oh, no! Bloody Branagh beat  me to it!  It was only because he was in  that flaming Potter film as well! I could have been Dumbledore!  I could have been Lockhart!  I could even have been Hermione bloomin'  Grainger, but oh, no, Brannagh's got to get in on the act!"<br>
      Rogers didn't know how a bed pan had got onto the bridge,  but you never knew when such a thing would come in handy.  </p>
    <p>&lt;Cue: Batman sound effect of your choice:</p>
    <p>KAPOW!        THWACK!     BAM!              KABLAM!      Or       WALLOP!      </p>
    <p>(delete as  appropriate)&gt;<br>
      (Yes,  interactive A &amp; E has arrived! Prepare your bedpans!)</p>
    <p>All attention returned to the viewscreen at Maureen's  terminal, as the main viewscreen still had a chair parked in the middle of  it.  <br>
  "So, has anyone any ideas?"<br>
  "I've told you before – use chocolate in bread and butter  pudding!  It's really nice!"<br>
  "Another wonderful culinary tip brought to you by QVC Asian  division. Thank you George.  I meant  about what that thing is!"<br>
  "Well, the computer must have identified it, because it's  labelled underneath".<br>
      They all stared incredulously at George.  <br>
  "Our computer?   Identify something?  Are you mad?"<br>
      There was a huffily seductive "Hmmmph!" echoing around the  bridge.<br>
  "Well what does it say then?" uttered George.<br>
      <SPAN STYLE="font-size: 6px;">ITEMS IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR MAY BE CLOSER THAN  THEY APPEAR.</SPAN><br>
      Maureen struggled in vain to read the tiny lettering.<br>
  "Computer, change to Times New Roman!"<br>
  "Please state font size" uttered a seductive voice.<br>
  "I don't care, as long as I can see it!"<br>
  "Invalid command. Please re-state.  Font sizes must be whole numbers".<br>
  "Quit messing around, or I'll upgrade you to Windows 3.11".<br>
      The text appeared instantly on the screen: </p>
    <p>"OBJECTS IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR MAY BE CLOSER THAN THEY  APPEAR".</p>
    <p>"Well, that was helpful", piped up Maureen.  <br>

  "That's easy for you to say!" said George.<br>
  "If you put it like that!" said Rogers.<br>
  "BOING!  Time for  bed!" said Zebedee.<br>
  "I've got a bad feeling about this!" Rogers mused.</p>
    <p>&lt;Voice from the sidelines: <br>
  "Well if you've read this far, I'm not surprised!"&gt;</p>
    <p>"I guess that's what we get for trying to TWANG with one  foot!" the Captain continued, as the <i>Frazer</i> slowly limped past a massive  sign post:-</p>

    <p>There was a dull thud from somewhere below decks, as a huge  chunk of  rock carved it's way through  the outer skin of the hull to deck 6.  No  real damage was done, as this part of the ship was mostly dedicated to inconsequential  crewmen's quarters, at least a dozen of which now had former occupants  performing open space freefall practice.   But at least that meant shorter queues at the staff canteen.</p>
    <p>"Someone's shooting at us!" yelled Ball, staggering to his  feet.<br>
  "That was no laser blast!   Something hit us!" bellowed Rogers. <br>
  "Hit US?!  As in, not  just ME?! Well that's novel!" exclaimed Ball.</p>
    <p>Maureen was the first to notice the repetitive beeping  coming from Brian's communications terminal.  </p>
    <p>"Sir!  We're being  hailed!"<br>
  "Quick! On speakers!"<br>
      Suddenly the air was filled with sound, as the bridge  speakers crackled into life.  The  reverberating noise that emanated throughout the ship would normally only be  heard on a BT nuisance phone call complaints line.  The deep heavy breathing rattled the  glassware.<br>
  "Should I patch this through to deck 36 for you Captain?"  enquired Maureen.<br>
      All of a sudden, they noticed another noise coming from the  communications console.  The patch-line  was still hooked up to Doc Brown's answer-phone muzak.  </p>
    <p>DUN, DUN, DUN, DUM-DE-DUM, DUM-DE-DUM!<br>
      DUN, DUN, DUN, DUM-DE-DUM, DUM-DE-DER!</p>

    <p>Rogers hit the switch hard.   This had no effect whatsoever.  He  hit the control three more times, and finally resorted to peering down the end  of the tube.  He pushed his communicator  button.  <br>
  "Brown, if you can find the time, could you have a look at  my Acquavac?"</p>
    <p>Doc Brown had plenty to do.   It's not easy fitting forty-foot long elastaplasts on the outside of a  moving spaceship in the middle of an asteroid field, whilst trying to work out  how one universe can be exactly two months out of phase with another one.  (The writers had promised to tell him just as  soon as they got back from the Bahamas).   "Bastards!" he blurted, as he hit his thumb trying to nail a large  wooden plank to the outside of Ensign Goodbody's window.  The security officer in question didn't seem  too pleased at the prospect, however.</p>
    <p>Voice from the Sidelines: "It's bad when we can't even think  of something stupid for the Captain's Log!"</p>
    <p>                                                                                    &lt;Cue:  Tacky Sixties Music&gt;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Back on the bridge, repair crews hummed with activity (well,  the Imperial March is a very catchy tune).   One ensign had got particularly carried away, and was busily painting an  image onto the viewscreen.  Well, you  never know when a centre-spread of Sylvia Krystal may turn out to be  relevant.  (Sorry, in-joke).  </p>
    <p>Brown had a strange feeling, like someone was looking over  his shoulder.  This was odd, as he was  currently outside the <i>Frazer</i>.  A  ghostly shadow silently passed by, and Brown cautiously turned to cast his eyes  on what lay behind him in the void.  (He  found himself thinking how similar it was to unblocking the loos on deck  9).  </p>
    <p>Inside the ship, pandemonium reigned, then it sleeted, then  there was a small break for sunshine, then they ritually sacrificed Michael  Fish and bothered to look at the massive vessel that stood off the port  bow.  <br>
  "HOW BIG?!"<br>
  "Massiveski, you stupid American pig-dogski!"<br>
  "Can you put it on the screen?"<br>
  "Ze magnification von't go dat lowski!"<br>
  "That's a relief, I prefer Sylvia Krystel anyway!"<br>
      Ball snatched the read-out from George's hand, and gazed at  the numerical information.  He mouthed  the words as he read them.<br>
  "Once one is one.  Once  two is….."<br>
      George looked over his shoulder.<br>
  "Well, you're always telling us to <i>Think of a Number!"</i><br>
  "Vot seriesski was dat an episode from?" Trotski enquired.<br>
  "Last of the Summer <i>Whine</i>".<br>
  "Ah!  A classicski  sit-com!  Created by Rrrussian peasant in  1431!"<br>
      The craft in question was like a massive floating  cheesewedge.  In fact the Federation  would have been proud, if it weren't for the fact that they were currently in a  different Universe, past the traffic lights, and left at the post office.  It was also about a mile long, and covered in  strange unfamiliar markings.  <br>

    <p>"Oh boll----"<br>
  "No! Don't go there!   We can use that idea next time!"&gt;</p>
    <p>"There's something else" motioned McAfee, spying at the  viewscreen, which wasn't easy because Sylvia Krystel's bra-straps kept getting  in the way.<br>
  "High Yapping?!  Do  you suppose they're Chinese?"</p>
    <p>&lt;Voice From the Sidelines: They've only just sent a man  into space, and the first thing they do is operate an intergalactic traffic  warden department!  If they're not in the  Axis of Evil yet, they should be now!"&gt;</p>
    <p>All of a sudden, heavy breathing filled the speakers  again.  <br>
  "How come all this is going on and the Captain's not about?"  queried George.<br>
  "He's had a paddy, and he's in his trailer."<br>
  "What was he upset about?"<br>
  "The script didn't have his shirt getting ripped until page  9".<br>
  "You mean, there's nine pages of this?!"<br>
  "Yeah, but it is a two-parter!"<br>
  "YOU ARE PART OF THE REBEL ALLIANCE, AND TRAITORS! YOU'RE  ALSO PARKED ON A DOUBLE YELLOW ASTEROID! SHOW US SOME IDENTIFICATION!"<br>
  "You don't need to see our identification", said McAfee,  waving her arm in front of her face for no apparent reason.  <br>
  "THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK, SMART-ARSE, NOW PULL OVER!"<br>
      Ball glanced down at his chest.<br>
  "Actually, no sleeves, it's a tank top. Although I'm  particularly proud of the green and purple stripes.  And my mum did the flowers."<br>
      The bridge rocked as the ship was hit by a massive impact. <br>
  "What was that?!" screamed Maureen.<br>
  "A laser bolt!" replied Ball.<br>
  "I didn't know they held laser's together with bolts!"<br>
  "Never mind that, best do as he says George."<br>
      George looked in the mirror, indicated and brought the ship  to a dead halt, before engaging the hazard warning lights.<br>
  "NOW YOUR IN A DISABLED BAY!"<br>
  "Well, our ship <i>is</i> disabled!  That last laser blast had something to do  with it!"<br>
  "And the TWANG's gone out of our Wibble brackets!"<br>
      The doors of the turbo-lift parted, and Rogers strutted  stroppily onto the bridge.  Ball backed  away.<br>
  "What's going on here?   Why have we stopped?  What's with  the Sylvia Krystel centre-fold?"<br>
      McAfee handed him a copy of this month's script.  The captain glanced through it.<br>
  "I see…my Acquavac's arrived!"  He read another page, tore the paper up and  threw it over his shoulder.<br>
  "Scripts are for wimps!   And extras!"<br>
      The intercom boomed again:<br>
  "I'M STILL HERE YOU MORONS!"<br>
  "And who the hell are you?" stormed Rogers.  <br>
  "WILLIAM NORMAN STANLEY GIBBONS ACRINGTON ROGERS, IS THAT  YOU?"<br>
  "I've never told that name to anyone!  Who are you?"<br>
  "I AM….YOUR MOTHER!"<br>
  "NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!"</p>
    <p>DUN, DUN, DUN, DUM-DE-DUM, DUM-DE-DUM!<br>
      DUN, DUN, DUN, DUM-DE-DUM, DUM-DE-DER!</p>
    <p>"Oh, sorry, it's my agent, I really need to take this  call"  said Ball, scrambling for his  phone.<br>
      Blood splattered through the air as Ball went reeling from  the blow and slammed into the bulkhead.<br>
      Rogers still wasn't satisfied.  So he shot thirteen security guards, and  threw Brian straight into Sylvia Krystel's chest.<br>
      A voice boomed over the speakers again.<br>
  "THAT'S MY BOY!"<br>
      Rogers hit the communicator button on his newly re-installed  tacky-sixties imitation leather effect chair.  <br>
  "Brown!  You got that  TWANG fixed yet?!"<br>
  "Great Scott!   Acrington?! Your mum's truly evil!"<br>
  "You should've seen how nasty she could be with a mop and  bucket!  They don't call her Darth Wader,  Dark Lord of the Sitting Room for nothing!"</p>
    <p>&lt;Voice from the sidelines: "I want it as a matter of  public record, writer number one had NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT LAST GAG!"&gt;</p>
    <p>"Well, captain, Einstein's just finished tying all the  hair-bands from the make-up department together, and I'm just attaching them to  the wiggling shaft rotator spline-grease nipple magnet".<br>
  "Have you been MacGyvering around on deck 36 again?!"<br>
  "Well, I needed the PVC for strategic tortioning of the  wizme doodle fladge nibblets, but we are going to have to stop off at Office  World at some point to re-supply with elastic bands and Post-It notes.  Also, we're getting a little bit low on  Bonios, so that means a trip to Pet Planet as well."<br>
  "When you're ready, Mr Brown. Only I'd quite like to get out  of here before my mother invites me round for Sunday lunch."<br>
      Brown dangled the latest copy of <i>French Poodle Topless</i> magazine in front of Einstein's face and watched as he went cross-eyed and  began to drool.  One carefully directed  kick was all it took to send the pedals whizzing and the tortion arm began it's  slow movement towards critical mass as the <i>Frazer</i> lurched forward under  the violent thrust of engaged TWANG.   Unfortunately no-one was steering so it ran straight into the  neighbouring vessel. <br>
      Ensign Goodbody stood aghast.  The violence of the impact had knocked the  wooden covers from her window and having just stepped out of the shower she was  now on full display to the bridge crew of the Imperial Super Star Destroyer <i>Bloody  Big Monster Ship, </i>who stood, eyes popping out of their heads and tongues  drooling.  <br>
  "THAT'S DISGUSTING!"<br>
  "You should try deck 36!" replied Rogers.  "Now lets get out of here.  This time, the other way!"<br>
  "Vot are we going to doski about ze Star Vorz enemy wessel,  oh brave American pig-dogski keptain?!"<br>
  "We'll let the legal department take care of that!"<br>
  "Careful, captain, that's what they said on <i>Battlestar  Galactica</i>!" scoffed McAfee.<br>
  "Just hold on to your pantyhose, we're heading for the M25!"<br>
  "Great.  Another car  park."</p>
