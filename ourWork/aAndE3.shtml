        <P><i>The Studios of QVC News, </i><br>
          <i>Welwyn Garden City, Earth,</i><br>
        <i>About 10.32 pm</i></P>
        <p>"…And finally, a dog has been seen  skateboarding down Putney high Street….No, sorry, wrong story.  Good news, after a long hiatus of several  months which occurred for no apparent reason, <i>Star Trek A &amp; E </i>is  about to return. Here's a special report from Kate Adie…."<br>
          &lt;Cue:  Tacky Sixties Music…&gt;</p>
        <p align="center"><i>"STAR TREK A &amp; E  IS SPONSORED BY DYNO ROD!!"</i></p>
        <p>"…No they're not bloody well here yet!  Months it's taken to get this back off the  ground, and they can't even be bothered to turn up.    Well, you tell the director of <i>Desperate  Housewives</i> that the ship needs it's captain back….and as for the producer  of <i>ER,</i> I don't care if they need extras for a story line involving two  colliding UFOs, we need Einstein!  Here  at QVC, we may not have an audience, but we do have your merchandising  rights!  And don't you forget it!"<br>
          Max Savings slammed his phone closed, and  screamed at the top of his lungs "WRITERS!   HERE! NOW!"  <br>
          Two dishevelled characters, one looking  like an extra from <i>Celebrity Fit Club</i>, the other tall and lanky with a  red folder and pair of cricket pads on (ever the optimist) ran instantly at the  sound of Max's voice – in the opposite direction.  <br>
  "So what have we got?"<br>
  "Apart from no budget, no cast, no set, no  studio and no script?"<br>
  "Basically"<br>
  "A cup of coffee and a doughnut"<br>
  "That's OK then.  It's amazing what you can do with pure brain  food…"</p>
        <p>&lt;Voice from the Sidelines : "So you  haven't thought of anything yet?"&gt;<br>
  "No".</p>
        <p><i>The Globe Theatre, London</i><br>
          <i>About Tea-Time</i></p>
        <p>"Now, now, don't distress yourself, here,  have another box of tissues".<br>
  "PPPPPPWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"<br>
  "Didn't you read the small print?"<br>
  "I'm an act-or! And they gave me a contract!  You don't read small print!  Can you believe it?  Years, I've waited!  Years!   All my life I've dreamed that this day would come!  All those years ago when I started at the  lowest level possible, a budding actor, understudying to Donald Sindon's understudy  in <i>Never the Twain Shall Meet!  </i>At  last I'd arrived!  Who'd imagine?  Moi! Top billing!  King Lear! On the stage of the Globe  Theatre!  This should be my moment!  This should be all I dreamed of! "<br>
  "It's only one more season!"<br>
  "I can't believe they pulled this on me! A  little-known, seldom used, reverse activation clause!  In other words, they drafted me!  And my agent shaf----"<br>
  "Now, now, family show…."<br>
  "Where did QVC ever get the money from?"<br>
  "Apparently it's being sponsored by Dyno  Rod.  And the action figures of Commander  Ball actually sell very well at conventions.   You can use them as punch bags as well, apparently".<br>
  "I suppose I'll have to be whacked by that  moron of captain again, at least twice an episode"<br>
  "Oh, don't worry about him, he may have  mellowed, after all, he's been on <i>Desperate Housewives</i>.  Literally."<br>
  "Then there's that stupid fur ball prop!"<br>
  "That's no way to talk about Einstein!  Did a damn good job as an extra on <i>ER!</i>"<br>
  "I meant that damn Brian, did you see how  embarrassing it was?  Him, representing  us?  On the Eurovision Song Contest!"<br>
  "Yes but that nice Ensign Goodbody did a  lovely job of comparing"<br>
  "I didn't know you watched The Fantasy  Channel! "<br>
  "Look on the bright side.  At least you aren't made to wear a red  shirt…..!"<br>
  "I bet they have me walking round with a  sink plunger", he moaned through a soaked hankie.  </p>
        <p>If the power of a glaring stare could break  glass, Max Savings wristwatch would have exploded exponentially.  He dragged heavily on his fourteenth cigar  that morning, which considering he still had the other thirteen in his mouth  was quite a challenge.  But then if you  could juggle a QVC budget, you could juggle anything.  Apart from, that is, a newly-starting  soon-to-be-cancelled naff sci-fi show, and it's participants.  He strode outside to the sound and vision of  a beat-up Skoda smashing into the dustbins outside and coming to a violently  juddering halt.  (He'd missed it  kangarooing through the red traffic lights, over the pavements and through the  at least one pedestrian underpass.  Not  to mention through the living room of number 32, Alston road, Welwyn Garden  City.  <br>
  "Who's that?" asked Ensign No-Name, who'd  been working as a car park attendant during the off-season.<br>
  "Must be the new navigator.  Funny, didn't think we'd be getting Deanna  Troi!"<br>
  "Any chance of wearing this day-glo vest  during filming?  If I'd have been in my  red shirt, I'd have been under that car, and resembling a jam pancake!"<br>
  "Let's see, yellow security officers,  probably about the norm for this show."<br>
          The car's doors opened, and clattered to  the ground, and Deanna Troi climbed calmly out. (JUST KIDDING!) Actually,  Maureen climbed calmly out.  The  remaining passengers staggered on hands and knees.  They slowly clawed their way clear of the  rancid surroundings of the East European <i>Potential Death Trap </i>in which  they had arrived.  Each in their own turn  kissed the ground and collapsed exhausted as the shear relief of escape from  their worse nightmare overcame them.  A  very peculiar sound could suddenly be heard, emanating from the Skoda's  boot.  Maureen calmly lifted the lid,  reached in with one hand, out emerged, pinched between finger and thumb, and  held at arm's length, was a gibbering fur-ball, swamped in his own vomit.  </p>

        <p>"Well that was uncalled for!"<br>
  "No-need for language like that!"<br>
  "I'm sure her mother was actually very  nice"<br>
  "Never mind all that" exclaimed Maureen,  "What do you mean, the light was red? That's the last time I give you a lift.  Look what you've done to my shagpile!" <br>
          (At this point, writer number one sneezed  and only a lack of Equity membership prevented him from making it into the  actual story.  If he had, it would  probably be more interesting).</p>
        <p>"Who the hell's that?" Max asked of the  finally arrived writers.  <br>
  "That's Maureen.  Can't you tell?"<br>
  "Well, who was that we had last season?"<br>
  "Ah.   We couldn't afford eye candy since the incident with the short bloke  with the umbrella".<br>
          Max's lip wobbled uncontrollably, sending a  storm of cigars shooting in all directions. <br>
          The three other occupants of the car at  last began to show some signs of coherence.   Trotski gazed at the mangled metal.<br>
  "You stupidski sheski American  pig-dogski!  Look vot youv doneski to diz  beautifulski example of superior Rrrrussian technology!"<br>
  "But it's a piece-of-crap Skoda!"<br>
  "How dare youski?  Ze Skoda is inwention of finest Rrrussian  peasantski in 1142!"<br>
  "But it's only ten o'clock!"<br>
  "Scumski!"<br>
          George was by now coherent, and feeling the  bruises on his forehead that he'd managed to somehow obtain en route.  <br>
  "That's the last time I ever get in a car  that's being driven by a former star of <i>Driving School</i>!" <br>
          Max stared at the short, frumpy, aged Welsh  woman with bad dress sense that now stood in front of him, eagerly gripping her  car keys.<br>
  "This is not going to help ratings."<br>
  "It was your idea to re-cast Maureen.  Again."<br>
  "Yeah, but they didn't need to use  concrete"</p>
        <p>&lt;Voice from the Sidelines: Two and a  half pages in, and they're still in the car park!"<br>
          Still, they have managed to get out of the  car, which is more than they managed to do in <i>Jurassic Park!"  Dinosaur merchandise available in our upcoming  spring sale, with optional novelty sink </i><br>
  <i>plunger attachments and drain fittings.</i>&gt;</p>
        <p>Once Max savings had managed to remove the  car keys from where they had been violently shoved by re-re-cast Maureen, his  attention was drawn to a wailing sound approaching from up the road.<br>
  "There she blows!"<br>
  "Eh?   That's Ball! Doing his Ahab!  I  thought Patrick Stewart got that gig!"<br>
  "I heard he got some sort of job at the  Globe.  I guess it was to be or not to  be.  Why is he here?"<br>
  "That <i>is </i>the question."<br>
  "Ah well, once more unto the <i>bridge</i>,  dear friends, once mo—urgh!"  Ensign  No-Name fell to the ground like a sack of spuds in a spin-dryer as Ball's fist  impacted on his nose.<br>
  "Uncalled for, wasn't it?  <br>
          Ball just glared back at Max Savings.<br>
  "Prick us shall we not bleed.  Wrong us, shall we not avenge.  Mock us shall we not GIVE YOU A SMACK IN THE  MOUTH!!!"  a still tearful Ball replied.</p>
        <p>A second wailing sound was heard  approaching, and a ramshackle pedal car ambulance drew up outside.<br>
  "Oi!   The Bugsy Malone re-make is on Lot 13!" bellowed Max savings.<br>
          With that the rear doors flew open, and  Doctor Doug and Nurse Gladys Emmanuelle leapt from the back and pulled out an  operating trolley to which was strapped a gagged and very perturbed looking Doc  Brown.  They raced up to the huddle of  dishevelled hired helps amassed in the middle of the empty sound stage,  crashing through a set of double swing doors which had been put there for no  readily apparent reason, as Einstein followed on behind sporting a white coat,  a stethoscope and a holding a clipboard in his mouth.  <br>
  "He's been taking that <i>ER</i> role <i>way </i>too seriously!" mumbled George.<br>
          The four of them reached the others and  they pulled the gurney to a stop, just as it had finished running over Max  Saving's toes.<br>
  "Fourteen hours in surgery and we still  couldn't remove that damn colander!   We  think he's been spending time on Deck 36 as well, cause we couldn't get the  smile off his face either!"<br>
          Outside in the car park Ensign No-Name  noticed that it was starting to rain, and reached for his waterproof  parka.  He just finished pulling up the  zip on the bright red garment when a huge chauffer-driven gleaming white  stretch limo came flying round the corner, smashing into the unsuspecting car  park attendant, sending him flying over the bonnet, across the roof, through  the mini-bar, only to drown in the swimming pool bolted to the back of the  chassis.  The chauffer exited the front  seat and walked round the front of the car, slowly opening the rear doors as  though royalty itself were about to disembark.  </p>
        <p>A picture of the seventies stepped from the  rear compartment, the crisp freshly-ironed white suit in stark contrast to the  clunky medallions that hung blatantly inside the open jacket, clearly visible  against the black sequined waistcoat, making them sparkle more than the teeth  in a Saturday morning cinema hero's smile.   Attached to this was a rampant Ensign Goodbody, dressed in almost  nothing but a long feather boa and a broad grin.  </p>
        <p>&lt;Cue: Music                                                             T<i>ragedy</i> by the Bee Gees&gt;</p>
        <p>&lt;Voice from the sidelines: "Shouldn't  that be <i>Saturday Night Fever</i>?"<br>
  "You know we're right.  It's either that or <i>Staying Alive</i>!"&gt;</p>
        <p>Rogers swaggered nonchalantly toward the  massed group, the gold tip on his cane glinting in the studio lights.  Everyone stared, open mouthed as he  approached the group, even Max Savings seemed speechless at Rogers' blatant  arrogance as he reached  the others.  He eyed them with an air of total disdain.  <br>
  "Underlings", Rogers addressed his  audience, whilst simultaneously striking the heavy metal end of his swagger  stick deep into Ball's face.  <br>
  "Anyone wants me, I'll be in Trailer 36…"<br>
          &lt;Cue: Tacky Sixties Music&gt;<br>

        <P>Captain's Log – Stardate: A Week Last Tuesday (Star Trek A  &amp; E Calendars are available from the QVC Mega Offer Hotline)</p>
        <p>The <i>Frazer </i>is currently on assignment in the Stilton  Sector, Blue vein 23, actually doing what we're supposed to be doing – my god,  what has the Universe come to?  </p>
        <p>The map-making scanners are on maximum suppression, as  obviously are the writers because we've had three lines with no sign of any  innuendo, and Ball is working hard to complete the new edition of the road  atlas using the new paint with numbers which he got for Christmas.  And I'm really, really bored.  </p>
        <p>"Have you noticed that if you stare at a flashing cursor for  long enough, you hypnotise yourself?"   muttered Rogers as he glared at the open Word document on his view  screen.  His left hand flexed on the  wooden grip of a caveman-like club and he smashed it into the deck plate, he'd  soon got bored of hitting people when nobody paid any attention.  <br>
          This work thing was the pits.  <br>
  "Can't we just go and blow something up?"<br>
  "Try your Vinyl Vera.   She's on Deck 36".</p>
        <p>(Vinyl Vera is available from the QVC order hotline – offer  open only to over 18s, or Lib Dem MPs and only after 10pm).</p>

        <p>"SIR!"<br>
  "Urghh?"<br>
          Maureen shook  the captain's shoulder in a vague attempt to bring him to consciousness.<br>
  "Wake up  sir!  We have a priority call!"<br>
  "Tell him  I've paid the bill for the chat line…."<br>
  "No, sir,  it's Admiral Camembert!  We have new  orders!"<br>
  "You mean  someone's paying money for that calendar?"<br>
  "No-one's  that desperate, no, we're being re-assigned, something about a convention?"<br>
  "Not another bloody convention! If I see one more raving  loony with a great big axe and a Eurovision Song Contest outfit, I'm gonna go  insane!  And as for that bloody awful  fan-fiction…"<br>
          Ball looked up from his scanner.  "I'm confused, did he say he was <i>gonna</i> go insane?!"<br>
          Ball knew when he'd said the wrong thing, and realised it  was one of those moments as he got back up off the floor, and attempted to mop  the blood off his uniform.  <br>
  "Well, the day hasn't been a complete loss, at least I  managed to practice my golf swing, and we got some violence and innuendo on the  first page".<br>
  "Keptain stupid American Pig-Dog-ski, Admiral-ski  Camembert-ov is still holding on line three-ski.  He's already listened to QVC hold music-ski  twice, and he hazen't even bought-ski a single calendar yet!"<br>

  "Well I wasn't going to go into the attributes of the  centrefold on page eight in quite that much detail but I totally agree about  Miss November"<br>
  "Vot about the Admiral-ski?" <br>
  "Patch it through to my Oven-Ready Room."<br>
  "CUT!!!  What's this  Oven-ready Room?!  You realise we've got  to build a whole new set?  We'll have to  furnish it with fish, glass-top tables, panoramic windows, plasma screens,  comfy chairs….."<br>
          Max Savings began to perspire profusely, he grabbed the  script, yelled expletives that even <i>we</i> won't publish and began to  feverishly re-write.  He turned on a heel  and stormed towards his office doorway, hurling the wad of crumpled papers in  the face of Writer Number Two as he did so.</p>
        <p><del>"Patch it through to my Oven-Ready Room."</del><br>
  <span style="font-family: cursive;">"I'll take it in Shuttlebay Three"</span>.</p>
        <p>The Captain reclined on his park bench, and looked at the  widescreen portable black and white monitor perched on the pile of packing  crates, where a blurry image was trying to form.  <br>
  "Rogers!?  Rogers is  that you?  You're looking a mess….tidy  yourself up, man!"<br>
  "Trying fiddling with aerial a bit sir".<br>
  "Now look here, Rogers, what you get up to on Deck 36 is  your business, but when you're talking to me, keep it clean, or I'll have your  commission!"<br>
  "Really?  So how many  calendars shall I put you down for, than? They've got a lovely picture of Nurse  Gladys on the front cover, although I'm not sure using Einstein was the wisest  move".<br>
  "Quit blathering, boy! Have you gone completely mad?"<br>
  "Is that a rhetorical question?"<br>
  "Shut up and listen to me!   Honestly I don't know why we bother!"<br>
  "Didn't know you did Admiral…"<br>
  "Enough!! You've gone too far!"  <br>
  "Most people say not far enough…"<br>
          At this point, Rogers couldn't quite tell if the reception had  gone again or if that really was steam coming out of the Admiral's ears.  Camembert was squinting at the screen.<br>
  "That first officer of yours.  The one standing at that control panel.  Get him over here on the double…"<br>
  "Sir?  There's no-one  here you old fool, we're on the hanger deck!"<br>
  "Rubbish!  I can see  him there, the bridge set is just next door!"<br>
          Rogers rolled his eyes, turned to his left and yelled out  "Oi, git face, Admiral Cannonball Von Toshburger wants to speak at you.  Don't take all day, we've a commercial break  in a minute!"<br>
          Ball took a moment to compose himself, and walked cautiously  through the gap in the Bridge set, taking care to avoid tripping on the  polystyrene boulders on the way.<br>
  "Ah, Ball!  Good!  I hereby promote you to the field rank of  acting Captain, may god have mercy on your soul, …"<br>
  "Ah! At last!  I told  you I was an act-OR!  No more of this  underling first officer rubbish!  I've  finally got my proper place in life!  The  dizzy heights of command!  The being  weighted on hand and foot!  The keys to  the executive washroom on Deck 36!  The  tacky plastic chair!  Mine, mine, all  mine!"  Ball wasn't the only one who knew  when he'd said the wrong thing.  The  Admiral shook his head in resigned disappointment.<br>
  "Rogers! I say Rogers!   Answer me when I'm shouting at you!"<br>
  "Yes, sir?"<br>
  "That's your superior officer you're beating to a pulp!  If he regains consciousness in time, he could  have you <del>thrown out of an airlock</del>….!"</p>
        <p>                                     <span style="font-family: cursive;">Shot!</span>"      </p>
        <p>Max Savings handed the script back to Writer Number Two and  stalked off mumbling.<br>
  "We can't afford a ruddy airlock!"<br>
          Rogers picked his jaw up off the floor.  He wasn't used to being speechless.  But there was a first time for  everything.  And for once, that didn't  involve Ensign Goodbody on Deck 36. <br>
          Ball squared up to his long-serving superior officer.  He glared deep into Rogers eyes, and then  with one swift motion kicked him straight in the groin.<br>
          Ball waved his finger at two bored looking Red-Shirts.<br>
  "You and you!"<br>
          The two security officers gazed  at each other with a look of mortal  fear.  <br>
  "Grab this freak of nature, and throw him in the brig, and  if he gives you any trouble, you have my permission to shoot first and ask  questions later.  But if that happens,  remember to shoot him <i>first </i>before you get caught in your own  cross-fire!"<br>
          Ball gave one last boot to Rogers' ribs before they could  drag him away.<br>
  "Ah, the privileges of rank!" commented Ball, dusting his  hands as he casually stepped back through the gap in the sets, made his way  over to the tacky plastic imitation leather, vinyl encrusted, 100%  poly-urethane, completely non-fire-retardant with built in soap dispenser and  toothbrush holder and stroked the imitation covering, lustfully, as he sat and  viewed his new domain.  All in all, his  new chair, was a 'potential death trap!"<br>
          (No Lynn Faulds-Woods were harmed in the making of this  episode).<br>
          At the helm, George glanced over at (Re-cast) Maureen.<br>
  "OK, we're really screwed now…"<br>
          On the main view screen, the Windows 95 Starfield  screensaver vanished, to be replaced momentarily by Men and Motors Plus One –  An  Emmanuelle Night Special, before  switching back to the blurred image of enraged Admiral Camembert, who's face  had now turned the colour of ripe beetroot. <br>
  "BALL!  SIT DOWN AND  LET ME GIVE YOU YOUR RUDDY ORDERS BEFORE I PROMOTE THIS BLASTED TRIBBLE TO  COMMODORE!!!"<br>
  "bkfhjrehkhrjfrhl4ul56uopyuigliylo4u6ylortuyh5kul45jyljltgk6lkjhkiytlk6juyki5ulu56lijgl4;oy4;pl;45ul;ul;45;;y56ulhelloagainritajlkhfjkhrekhrekhfrykek5ehkifk4kykhkhtkhkrtghktrhkrtkghkrtuk!"<br>
  "Does he always make noises like that?"<br>
  "Only on Thursdays, sir, it's Curry night".<br>
  "But you're supposed to be surveying Comets!  Don't tell me you've been studying Curry's  instead!"<br>
  "Well we've done from Abergaveny to York so far, and we  still haven't found the bits we need to repair the Aquavac". </p>
        <p>(Note: all QVC Aquavacs come with full back-to-base repair  and extended warranty cover).  </p>
        <p>"Well, listen.  You  can have your regimental orders or your marching order – your choice!"<br>
  "OK sir, I'm ready for the burdens of command".<br>
  "You're to make best speed to Terra Prime".<br>
  "Not Afghanistan!"<br>
  "No, worse than that.   Welwyn Garden City.  There's a  little event going on and we need our best crew to protect the guests…"<br>
          Ball flushed with pride. (DynoRod were on stand-by).<br>
  "…but they weren't available, so we're sending you lot  instead".<br>
          Ball frowned, but Camembert pressed on.<br>
  "The Ringway Holiday Inn is playing host to the pinnacle of  the Cheese Federations greatest minds.   The great ad the good are gathering, and the awards are being  polished.  The highest levels of Cheese  Federation 'Intelligence' Division has found absolutely nothing to suggest  there's any threat of any kind, we have therefore gone to our highest state of  alert for the duration of the event, and have banned the sale of beef on the  bone to over 65s.  Your job, should you  choose to accept it, and you have no choice if you want to keep that chair, is  to make sure that the event passes without so much as a spilt glass of Ribena  or a split cheese football.  Full  instructions are now being sent in a coded file on a ZX81 compatible signal  stream.  Ball, I wish you and your crew  good luck.  Actually I wish your crew  good luck.  This message will self  destruct in ten….."<br>
          The screen turned blue, with the words 'FATAL EXCEPTION  ERROR' filling the screen.<br>
  "George!  Full stop!"  hollered Ball in his most act<i>-or</i>ian accent. <br>
          George reached down below his chair, and pulled the hand  brake hard.  At the same time, he spun  the steering wheel ninety degrees, and did a full-about turn in less time than  it usually took Rogers to strip down to his underwear at an S &amp; M  convention.<br>
  "S &amp; M convention?!   That's more like it!  I trust  Claudia Black will be there!"</p>
        <p>&lt;Voice from the Sidelines:<br>
  "She won't ever read this, will she?"<br>
  "Well, it's not very likely".<br>
  "Yeah, but better safe than sorry".<br>
  "OK, please find full apologies in the plain brown envelope  delivered from QVC's over-eighteens and Lib Dem MPs Division".  &gt;</p>
        <p>"So, what is this thing we're attending then?" asked  McAffee, shrugging her shoulders from the Anti-Virus console.<br>
  "It's just coming through on the coded file, Brian is  patching it through to the main view screen.   It's a very complicated piece of software.  I'm not sure our computer can handle  it".  <br>
          McAffee's fingers were a blur on the keypad, as she  frantically tried to get the ship's systems to accept the complex sub-routines  that were attempting to melt the <i>Frazer's</i> logic circuits.  <br>
  "I think I've just about got it 'Acting' Captain."<br>
          Ball frowned as the main view screen went almost completely  black, save for a little white dot and one white vertical stripe on either  side, as Trotski and George suddenly found themselves embroiled in a game of  1970s Atari Tennis.  </p>
        <p>&lt;Atari Sports Consoles and a selection of replacement game  cartridges are available from the QVC Order Hotline&gt;.</p>
        <p>"That's not it!  Try  turning the cartridge over!"<br>
          McAffee reversed the polarity of the neutron flow, the  screen flickered, and in place of 1970s Tennis, up popped a page of complex  looking text and graphics.  Beneath the  Route finder printout, on a new page, was a hard copy of Camembert's original  orders.  <br>
  "There you go" said Ball, "the Technically Orchestrated  Spatial Science Examination Register's annual gala award ceremony., for the  brightest, and best achievements in the field of scientific endeavour".<br>
          George stared at the screen, mouthing the words as he read  them.  <br>
  <font size="+3">"It's  the TOSSERs!</font>"</p>
        <p>&lt;To be  continued&gt;</p>
        <p>In next month's enthralling episode…..can Ball keep  command…..?  Will the award ceremony descend  into chaos…..?  Will Rogers ever escape  his own brig…..? Will George beat Trotski at 1970s Atari Tennis? Or will he get  knocked out in the quarter finals?  All  will probably not be revealed in the next snooze-worthy instalment…</p>

        <p>Alas, poor bridge crew.   I knew them well, whether it is nobler in the tacky sixties chair, to  suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous left hooks…</p>
        <p>&lt;Voice from the Sidelines – Light Industrial Magic  Special Effects Department - "Hey, think budgets here!  It's slings <i>or</i> arrows…."</p>
        <p>"Excuse me!  Do you  mind not interrupting when I'm amusing…sorry, when I'm <i>musing</i>…..I went  to drama school for twenty three years, served my apprenticeship with the likes  of Gielgood, Attenborough, Phil and Grunt off EastEnders, and you're trying to  saddle me with the petty considerations of budgets!  Acting transcends money, it transcends life!  The Act-OR should hold an audience in the palm of his hand, not be shouted at  by a GREASY LITTLE OIK LIKE YOU!!!"</p>
        <p>&lt;Voice from the sidelines – "Alright, keep ya wig on!"<br>
  "You could never say that about Patrick Stewart!" <br>
  "But you could about Shatner!"<br>
  "Allegedly". &gt;</p>
        <p>"CUT!!!!", the director strode up to Ball's ear, while still  yelling into his megaphone.<br>
  "We'll not get anywhere at this rate! We've got a budget of  three pounds fifty an episode, and Rogers has just wasted that on a hot dog in  the staff canteen!</p>
        <p>&lt;At this point Writer Number Two came up with a really  crude joke about hot dogs and deck 36 which was immediately censored by Writer  Number One and the Drum Sergeant Major of the Household Cavalry.&gt;</p>
        <p>Tad Des-Parrot, the director, (may be responsible for season  finale) was looking slightly fraught.<br>
  "FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, you're supposed to be a  professional!  Can we just get this scene  out of the way, we've already got more than enough material for the out-takes  on the DVDs!  As well as <i>It'll Be  Alright On Deck 36 Tonight</i>, part 367, The Leather Fetish Special. Now can  be please GET ON?!"</p>
        <p>"Really! Directors!   So tetchy!  Now where was I? Oh  yes. "Slings, arrows, and outrageous left hooks…." "</p>
        <p>"WHAT DO YOU CALL THIS?!!   We can't allow this kind of leak to happen, you know DynoRod have got  the exclusive rights on leaks around here!   And before you know it, they'll be seeing complete episodes on the  Internet before they're finished!" erupted Max Savings as he stormed his way  onto the set, gesticulating wildly with a small stapled bundle of paper.  &lt;Don't forget to  go to <a href="http://www.a-and-e.wanadoo.co.uk/">www.a-and-e.wanadoo.co.uk</a>,  or visit QVC Publishings, but take care not to click on the calendars&gt;.<br>
  "Don't you know these are supposed to be trade secrets?  Which one of you idiots left that used toilet  roll you call a script lying about, and how did it end up in this journal of  iniquity?"  He threw a crumpled up copy  of this month's guest publication, the not entirely disposable <i>The Universe  Today</i> down at the director's   feet.  "Don't you realise we pay  good money for these scripts!""</p>
        <p>&lt;Voice From The Sidelines: "Oh no you don't!"&gt;</p>
        <p>"Oh good! Is it panto season already?" blurted Ball.<br>
          Des-Parrot held his head in his hands and wept openly, as a  large brown and white pantomime horse went trotting across the stage for no  apparent reason.  (But don't worry, it  was <i>Only Fools In Horses</i>).<br>
          All of a sudden, hundreds of voices shouted out in unison  "IT'S BEHIND YOU!"<br>
          Max stared in disbelief. "No! Not a <i>live</i> studio  audience!"</p>
        <p>&lt;Voice from the Sidelines – Light Industrial Magic  Special Effects Department - "Well, we can't afford a dead one…."</p>

        <p>&lt;Pantomine horse in a bikini – scary thought.&gt;</p>
        <p>The <i>Frazer</i> had arrived in a parking orbit, in the  ring-road above Welwyn Garden City.   Being parked wasn't intentional, but the road works just outside that well-known  London suburb, Bromsgrove, we're proving to be a real hazard for navigation,  and in fact, movement.  Throw in the fact  that the public toilets didn't work well under high-gravity conditions and  things were getting decidedly unpleasant.   Or <i>grim </i>for anyone north of the M4 ("It's Grim Up North!")</p>
        <p>But it wasn't all bad news as no-one had seen Captain Rogers  in days.  He was still in the brig,  bouncing his balls off the wall (much to Ensign Goodbody's amusement), back on  the bridge, chaos had not so much ensued as taken charge.  <br>
  "Ecting Britishski Stupid American pig-dogski Keptainski, ve  have arrivedski at the Vestern Kepitalist pigski slum, Welwyn Gardenski  City.  Estimated time to arrivalski, es  soon es zey clearski zese bloody coneskis, vich vere ancient inwention of  Rrrrussian peasant in 1368!"<br>
  "Y'know, that might be one invention you may not have wanted  to claim responsibility for" said George from the helm.<br>
          There was a pause-ski.<br>
  "Buggerski!"<br>
  "bcjhgukor6glklbeqtjyhlo46hflk45tkuvo45hgt,khrthutgiljr,jl45tthsrtkng,ajghl,wrknjkj.l.bkm./tnkr;yhil;jtbnea.,brtkn.rtkhnmjthelloritahihgkjvrhgkjrtbahleq5lghlafngknj.tka.rmjgl/rake'fgi.tjh.4jktgliugarkenfrkht,kg,rjg,kekn.em.h.lt."<br>
  "Yes, you would have thought the Universal Translator would  be able to a better job on that pseudo-Russian, wouldn't you?"<br>
  "Next month, I'll try running it through Babel Fish dot com"  chimed  McAfee from her station.<br>
  "And don't even think about claiming <i>that </i>one!"  warned George.<br>
  "But it <i>voz!</i> By famous Rrrrussian comedy writer and satirist  Douglaski Adamsovski, in 1791! I thought even you vould know zat!"</p>
        <p>Ball hit the bell on the Holiday Inn reception desk.  He hit it again.  He found he liked hitting things, he didn't  usually get the chance to do this.  (Next  thing you know he'll be ripping his shirt for no apparent reason)</p>
        <p>&lt;Voice from the other side lines – "BASIL! There's  someone at the desk, I'm on the phone!"<br>
  "Yes my little loathsome devil worshipper"<br>
  "What was that Basil?" came the high pitched response.<br>
  "Nothing dear, tell you what, why don't I get that, shall  I?  I wouldn't want to interrupt your  vital conversation about has-been actresses and the vitality of her  stretchmarks!"<br>
  "Yes, run along Basil…."&gt;</p>
        <p>A tall, moustached man in a tweed coat and cap strode out  from the office to the reception desk.<br>
  "Yes, you guessed it, the bell <i>does </i>work! Unlike my  wife!  Let's just test it again shall we?  Yes it still works!  I know, let's try it  with this cricket bat shall we? Here we go…"<br>
          Unfortunately the slightly startled Ball had forgotten to  remove his hand from the bell.  Think Tom  after being whacked by frying-pan wielding Jerry).</p>
        <p>&lt;Cue: Sound Effects budget….&gt;</p>
        <p>"AAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"</p>
        <p>&lt;Voice From The Sidelines: "Nothing like the sound of bat  on Ball, is there?"&gt;</p>
        <p>"Yes, how can I help you? "<br>
  "We'd like ten rooms and a first aid kit, please", said  George, pushing past the still howling Ball. <br>
  "Erm, well, alright then, if you must.  I'll just get the porter. If I can find  him.  He's from the planet Barcelona, you  know.  You can't get the staff, honestly,  I mean I'm up every day at five o'clock, running this dump, and for what….."<br>
  "Ahem."<br>
  "Hmm?"<br>
  "I do the rants, if you don't mind, it's in my contract!"  said a red-faced Ball.<br>
  "Tchh! Actors!  Tchh!"  the hotelier said, slamming a bunch of keys onto Ball's uninjured hand which he  was unwisely resting on the desk.   "Here's the keys to the rooms on the seventh floor, Manuel will bring  your bags up, if you're lucky.  <br>
          He turned around and strode back into the office, muttering  something about guests and what a pain in the neck they were.<br>
  "Honestly, we never had this trouble in Torquay…" murmured  Maureen from behind the mountain of suitcases.<br>
          Ball peered at one of the cases, which was covered in what  appeared to be a leopard skin effect cover.   "Wait a second, that's not one of mine!" he blurted, as he struggled to  lift it off the trolley.  <br>
  "This thing weighs a ton! What on Earth's someone packing in  here?"  It thudded down onto the floor,  and to the shock and surprise of everyone standing around, a muffled but  clearly audible "Urrgghh!" came from within.  <br>
          Ball grappled with the locks, and threw the lid open.  Rogers' fist flew out like a jack-in-a-box,  it connected straight into Ball's testicles &lt;at this point, Writer Number  Two nearly choked on a chocolate digestive&gt;.<br>
          Just at that moment, another tall, moustached man appeared  amidst the chaos, pointed at Rogers, who was emerging from the suitcase with a  face of a bulldog chewing a particularly viscous purple people eater, and bellowed  "Quock! Arrost that min!  Throw him bick  in the brog!"<br>
  "Can we have subtitles please?" enquired George, as six  burly red-shirted crewmen bundled Rogers threw the doors and back to his cell  aboard the <i>Frazer</i>.  As they  frog-marched him out, McAfee noticed a strange trail of soil coming from the  inside of Roger's trousers, and frowned, as the hotel's PA system played a  vaguely familiar tune.  She was sure she  recognised it from one of those old war film.</p>
        <p>"Do do.  Do-doo  do-do-do. Do-doo, Do-doo, Do-do, Do-do-do…………………." Etc.</p>
        <p>Max Savings was purple. Almost as purple as a purple people  eater that had been eating purple people!  <br>
  "Wait!  What do you  think you're doing?  We can't afford to  pay royalties for that!  Do you know who  wrote it?  Elmer flamin' Bernstein,  that's who!  And we still couldn't have  afforded it if it was written by Elma Fudd!   We're still paying off Weird Al for that thing about clones in season  one.-!"<br>
          There was a stony silence, as Max turned slowly to face the  audience, who much to his astonishment (but also relief) were still live.<br>
  "OK, I'll just go now and count some beans or something…."  He muttered as he was whisked off stage, by a strange hook device which caught  him around the neck and dragged him back into the wings, as booing erupted from  the on-lookers.<br>
  "Crabtree!  Vot are  you doing here, you stupidski English French American pig-frogski!  I thought you ver vorking at Fedewation  Headqvarters?!"<br>
          The hotelier poked his head round the office door.  <br>
  "Oi! They'll be no 'qvarting' in my hotel, if you don't  mind!  If you want to do that sort of  thing, go back to Deck 36!"<br>
          Crabtree ignored him. "I om, but Headquiters sont me here to  oversoo socurity for the TISSERS."<br>
          The hotelier was still listening.  "What kind of accent is that?  You're not German are you?  We had some German guests once, but I think  we got away with it!"<br>
  "No, he's English, but the accent is supposed to be French,  although you could easily mistake it for Double Dutch" said George<br>
  "Really? In that case, don't mention the score!"<br>
  " I spoke Doble Dotch as well, for instance, 'Good  Groaning'"<br>
          Ball was getting restless, and glanced at the audience.<br>
  "Ok, never mind all that, what's your plan for dealing  with  these TOSSERS?"</p>
        <p>Half an hour later:<br>
  "Forceps, nurse." <br>
  "Swab".<br>
  "Suction"<br>
  "Ok, quite enough of that, Nurse, lets deal with the  patient."<br>
          Doctor Doug surveyed his patient on the gurney in front of  him.<br>
  "Did you ever see <i>Evolution?"</i></p>
        <p>Once the DIY anal probe which was composed of a table leg  and a rotting cabbage had been successfully extracted from Ball, (it's amazing  what an irate OAP can do with a walking stick) the crew gathered around an  over-head projector, in  a  broom-cupboard, in a particularly grotty looking corridor, which they had just  commandeered from Philip Schofield and Gordon the Gopher.  Philip had been fine about it but Gordon's  comments would have been completely unrepeatable had it not been for the  breakdown of the universal translator, but even then, you should have seen  Brian blush.<br>
  "Vhy are ve in here anyvay, you stupidski English  Americanski pig-dogski?" enquired Trotski.<br>
  "That stupid Englishski land-lordski….oh God, you've got me  doing it now!  That half-wit hotelier  double booked the conference with the 57th annual Cross-Stitch  Masters Convention, and they were given most of the conference facilities!"  replied Ball.  " We got this cupboard and  the triangular shaped conference room on the fifteenth floor!"<br>
  "Well why is that so bad?" enquired re-cast Maureen..<br>
  "It's called the Bermuda Suite, that's what!" exclaimed  Ball.<br>
  "Well, they were worried about the terrorist threat, and  guess what, the TOSSERS bombed!" said George, studying  in non-comprehension at the myriad of rings  and lines which Crabtree had drawn on the overhead projector.  <br>
  "That's Crabtree's game of noughts and crosses", pointed out  McAfee helpfully.  "The security plan is  on the next page".<br>
          George turned the page.   Comprehension was still several hours away from dawning.<br>
  "No, we're still screwed!"</p>
        <p>Outside in the corridor, a shadow lurked near the  broom-cupboard door - someone was listening….<br>
          <br>
  &lt;Voices from the balcony: "Might as well be listening,  'cos I bet they're not reading!"&gt;</p>
        <p>Back in the brig, Rogers leaned his head on the cell door,  arms folded, eyes shut, shirt ripped for absolutely no readily apparent  reason.  There was a rustling sound, and  Rogers stirred, and then poured in five teaspoons of sugar, and stirred  again.  His tea, (Tetley's, luke warm)  was standing on the floor in a big mug with the word 'BOSS' emblazoned on the  side – he had insisted on having <i>some</i> of the comforts of Deck 36 if he  had to spend any time at all in this god-forsaken hole.  He opened his eyes, rubbed his eyes, waking  from his state of woken plotting, and looked down at the piece of paper on the  floor, which was still half concealed where it had been pushed under the  plywood wall from the neighbouring cell. He picked it up and inspected it  further.<br>
  "Interesting note paper", he thought aloud.  "Perforated at both ends.  Must be written on the back cover of a script".  <br>
          He read the writing, which was scrawled in big, black  capital letters, which was fortunate, due to the difficulty he had with joined  up writing.:– </p>
        <p>"DO YOU WANT TO GET OUT OF HERE?"</p>
        <p>Roger's nostrils flared.   What kind of a question was that?!<br>
          He hunted around in his pocket for his favourite red crayon,  found it, and scribbled on the back:- </p>
        <p>"WOT DO U FINK? OF CORZE I DOO YOU MUPPETT!  HOO DE HELLL R U ENIWAY?</p>
        <p>He shoved the paper back under the wall.  Then he leaned down as close to the floor as  he could manage, and peered under the plywood….</p>
        <p>…and was startled to find a pair of bloodshot, desperate  eyes with air of insanity staring back at him…..</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>                                                                                                &lt;  TO BE CONTINUED &gt;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Who does the desperate bloodshot pair of eyes belong  to…?  Who is lurking in the shadow  outside the broom-cupboard….?  Which  classic BBC sit-com will be will receive the <i>A and E </i> treatment next month?  And will the live studio audience still be  live by then?</p>
        <p>Some, all or fewer of these questions may or may not be  answered in next month's cringe inducing episode….!</p>

        <P>Captain's Log: Stardate A week later than it should have  been (and written in chalk on the cell wall, 'cause I'm in prison, remember?)</P>
        <p>It's a little odd, this situation, starring, routed to the  spot, under the plywood partition divide in the brig at a pair of desperate  blood-shot eyes in the next cell, while trying to scrawl a captain's log on the  wall above me using chalk.  Of course, if  I was wearing fishnet stockings, being lashed with a leather whip, and lounging  on deck 36, it would have been perfectly normal.</p>
        <p>"AGGHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!"</p>
        <p>But now that I've realised that the pair of blood shot eyes  belong to me, and WHO THE HELL PUT A MIRROR THERE ANYWAY???!!!  It all makes almost perfect sense.</p>
        <p>&lt;Voice from the sidelines: "Where exactly was the mirror?  Oohh, sounds painful!"<br>
  "Excuse me (in top 'act-<i>or-</i>ian type fashion), I'm  supposed to be the captain at the moment, thank you very much!  I've waited for years for the opportunity to  postulate one of these idiosyncratic opening syntax.  If you think I'm going to be deprived now,  after years of honing my craft, of slaving my way from the lowest levels of  third-string back up to the pantomime horse to the lofty position I now attain,  thanks to my years of servitude to the dramatic ar----"</p>

          (Ball started to cry).</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Officer Crabtree was in his element.  He'd had important duties before, but today,  the fate of the Cheese Federation's finest representatives, and the crew of the <i>Frazer</i>, lay squarely on his shoulders.  <br>
  "Wit do you thunk you are doeing?" The red-shirted ensign  looked most bemused.  <br>
  "Suction three I tooled you!" He gave the sub-ordinate a  clip round the ear, and resorted to writing the instruction down and  gesticulating wildly with his truncheon.   Ensign Deadbeat was still none the wiser because not only could he not  understand badly spoken French, he couldn't read it either.  Virtually the entirety of the ship's  compliment had been drafted in.  All had  received similar detailed and well thought out instruction, had got completely  confused by it, and had all bundled off to the canteen.  </p>
        <p>Trotsky walked into the mess.  It wasn't always like that, but no one could  be bothered to tidy up.  He gazed at  virtually all of his shipmates as they sat around in the cafeteria.<br>
  "Vot do you thinkski you are all doing, you stupid American,  Englishski, non-pseudo-French speaking-ski pig-dogskis? "<br>
  "The script's rubbish!" said McAfee, turning away from the  slot-machine, "and the director has vanished!   What are we supposed to do?"<br>
          She noticed the look that flashed into Trotski's eyes.<br>
  "Well I'm not doing <i>that</i>! It's not in my contract!"<br>
  "Zat is not vwot you said on deck 36-ski".<br>
  "But, we're not on deck 36".<br>
  "Bugger-ski!"<br>
          Rogers was frustrated.   He could spend hours cooped up, not being able to leave a section of he  ship without it troubling him in any way.   However, that section of the ship was normally deck 36, and right at  this moment he longed for his Vinyl Vera and the blowlamp. The thudding noise  rebounded around his cramped enclosure, as the baseball continually rebounded  from floor to wall, and then back to his grasp, only to be thrown down into the  floor once more.  The sound was rhythmic  and comforting in the same way that Japanese water-torture is a nice icebreaker  at parties.  (Well, it was at the kind of  parties <i>he </i>went to).  <br>
  "Please stop! I can't take anymore!"<br>
          Rogers caught the ball (that's the baseball, not the first  officer, and if he'd been on deck 36, it would have been something completely  different).  <br>
  "Why on earth should I?"<br>
  "'Cause I'll go insane if that noise doesn't stop!"<br>
  "You're working on <i>A and E</i>, how much more insane can  you get?"</p>
        <p>&lt;Voice from the Sidelines: "Could be worse, you could be  writing it!"&gt;</p>
        <p>&lt;Voice from the Sidelines: "It could be worse than that –  you could be reading it!"&gt;</p>
        <p>Back in the hotel, the main auditorium was a hive of  activity.  It was the Cross Stitch  Convention's Cabaret Night.  Across the  hall, in the Luxury Meldrew Suite, the great and the good were gathering for a  night of a night of fun and debauchery.   Unfortunately, QVC's budget didn't extend that far, so they'd ended up  at the TOSSER's instead.  Tables buzzed  with glistening conversation, as the best of the Cheese Federation's scientific  elite waded their way through the pre-presentation dinner and speeches.  Furore erupted at one point, when someone in  the centre of the room ordered a green salad and the main dish of the day got  most upset.  </p>
        <p>&lt;Voice from the sidelines: "I think the exact words were  "I DON'T BELIEVE IT!!!!!" &gt;</p>
        <p>Crabtree was going into meltdown, as he raced around,  attempting to ensure the safety of the delegates.  He'd finally managed to get everyone to their  appropriate posts, and given them snazzy little earpiece communicators that  meant that none of them could get prosecuted for driving with a mobile  phone.  The host for the evening, the  Lord High Stinking Bishop was warming up for the big presentation, and the  first of a string of awards.  <br>
  "Luck at hom.  Anyone  would thunk he was the poop!" <br>
  "Don't you mean 'pope?'" McAfee asked.  <br>
  "I knoo what I moan!"<br>
          Back on the stage, the Big Cheese was well into his famous  anecdote about the chicken, the rabbi and the Swedish prostitute.  He'd already recounted the one about the  Vietnamese pot-bellied pig, the word search and the Aqua-Vac, and had a string  of notes about a mile long yet to wade through.  <br>
          It was about this point that the evening's organisers were  thankful they'd been spiking the Bishop's drinks all through dinner.  It was halfway through the gag about the  thermos flask and the Algerian limbo dancer that the pan-galactic gargle  blaster started to kick in.  And the  bishop kicked out.<br>
          George was keeping an eye on the proceedings from the wings  of the stage.  As the Stinking Bishop was  hauled away from the lectern, he turned to his accompanying Ensign, a young  Welshman by the name of Ivor Targetonmibak, and said "Thank goodness for  that.  I was starting to think that  bombing the TOSSER's wouldn't actually be such a bad idea!"</p>
        <p>High up in geo-stationery orbit, Brian was a tribble with  troubles.  The hardest thing about  keeping you foot on the gas peddle is that being a tribble, he didn't have  foot.  He tried rolling over it, he tried  bouncing up and down on it, he tried giving it one of his hard stares, and had  finally resorted to swearing profusely at it.</p>
        <p>"bijkadlrkh.bg;jhtho;jaslr;eotigulrwykueawr,ntgjr5ktih5lkjrhrtuhlie.rgkjglsrkejhtladtjhleykaje5;w4ejbgjsth.lgsrejh.lgjlao;eyhl;ejsyrhkarjk;jrgkhrhelloritabvfsdugcrwuyiHGFWLEYHYFWLHRKFHDJHJKBXFvjjsdrhrjrgkfghfkdjbknvfjbGJVKJJKBRTKvyjbjrdthmrkbfgjgjfhjjlhjlgkrhlifguhgufi"</p>
        <p>Yes, he was <i>that</i> upset.</p>
        <p>The problem was, that the entirety of the ship's compliment  had gone down to the surface leaving him solely responsible for keeping the ship  in stable orbit.  This had confused him t  start with.  He tried feeding it some  hay, and mucking out the toilets, but this had little effect, and without the  continued pressure being applied to the ship's accelerator, the ship was in  danger of stalling.  If this happened  Brian really would swear.</p>

        <p>The <i>Frazer's</i> nose dipped, as it began to drop in  altitude.  </p>
        <p>Tad Des-Parot was starting to get anxious   He'd begun this trilogy of episodes as the  director, one of QVC's finest (a dubious honour), and he couldn't quite work  out how he'd come to sharing a brig with the former captain and being driven  insane by the sound of someone repeatedly banging their balls.  </p>
        <p>&lt;Voice from the Sidelines: "We can't quite remember  either! &gt;</p>
        <p>"I tell you there's something wrong, Rogers, we need top get  out of here!"<br>
  "Well, I'm open to suggestions."<br>
  "Well, all the security guards have gone."<br>
  "What, all the ones in red uniforms?"<br>
  "Yeah, those guys."<br>
  "I expect they're dead."<br>
  "How?"<br>
  "You haven't watched this show much, have you?"<br>
  "That doesn't alter the fact we've gotta get out! Isn't  there some fancy, electronic technical gizmo that you can use or manipulate to  act as a main string plot device when everything else seems impossible?"<br>
  "What, you mean the sort of thing Doc Brown would come out  with?"<br>
  "Yeah, what would he do?"<br>
  "He'd probably fetch out a manually gravitated  counter-clockwise linkage agitating modulated inertially sequential latchment  oscillating traversment inducing device".<br>
  "WHAT?!"<br>
  "A key, you moron!"<br>
  "You have a key??!!"<br>
  "Of course I do! It's my ship you know!"</p>
        <p>On the bridge, Brian was <i>really</i> panicking.   A panicked tribble is a very scary sight, if only someone could have  been there to see it.  Not only had he  not been able to press the accelerator, but now the <i>Frazer</i> had begun  free-fall, he couldn't budge the brake either.  </p>
        <p>Back in the Meldrew  Suite, festivities were just re-commencing following the pitch invasion that  resulted when the Henley On Thames Patchwork Quilt Society decided to snake  their conga line down the centre aisle, across the stage, and through the  Stinking Bishop's dressing room, much to the hilarity of the town's women's  guild representatives. The presentations had continued apace, and so far, Doc  Brown had achieved special merit having received awards for both Most Original  Use of a Colander and Other Kitchen Utensils, and Scientific Quadruped  Experimentation Utilizing Oscillating Cycling Shorts and An Elastic Band  Dependency.  He'd also picked up the  award for  Best Use of a Chastity Belt In  Zero Gravity, which he collected on behalf of an absent Captain Rogers.</p>
        <p>Behind the prop façade that made up the backdrop to the  stage set, a shadowy dark cloaked figure made his way stealthily towards the  back of the podium, his four pawed feet moving cautiously to avoid all the  ropes, pulleys and paraphernalia that you tend to come across when someone has  put Officer Crabtree in charge of a security operation.  </p>
        <p>Rogers was taking a leaf out of Brian's book, and swearing  profusely.  He really should have  remembered that his key only worked on the handcuffs on deck 36. Tad Des-Parot  sobbed uncontrollably.  Luckily he was  standing next to the door controls at the time, and the resulting moisture  shorted the bypass circuitry, sending the doors to the cellblock flying conveniently  open.</p>
        <p>Fire erupted around the <i>Frazer's</i> hull, billowing  orange plumes snaked their way along the fuselage and through theship's  TWANG generators, as the atmosphere began to buffit the outer shell of the  ship's saucer.  It wasn't doing a lot for  the cups or teaspoons either.  Rogers and  Tad Des Parot were thrown through the now-open doorways and rammed violently  into the wall of the adjacent corridor.   Thankfully for their sakes, QVC sets weren't the most robust of  constructions, and they burst straight through the thin plywood onto the  neighbouring set.  </p>
        <p>Einsten wasn't prepared for what happened next.  He'd just been preparing himself to pounce on  the unexpecting speaker and launch his devastating evil scheme to destroy the  TOSSERs when two burly dishevelled Neanderthals, one of whom had ripped his  shirt for no apparent reason, and another that looked like he'd peeled too many  onions, burst through the set wall behind him making him leap backwards in  surprise, striking one of the conveniently placed levers at the side of the  stage.  This had the effect of seeing  three perfectly position sandbags drop from the gantries overhead, striking  both Einstein and his unexpected companions on the head, knocking them ut  cold.  Each of the sand bags was attached  to a neat coil of rope wound up on the backstage floor.  Of course, the law of physics demanded that  what came down also goes up.  (I cannae  change the laws of physics, but Doc Brown can!) As a result all three were now  suspended  and thoroughly entangled  amongst the lighting rigs and speaker systems that suspended above the  stage.  </p>
        <p>Ball and Crabtree ran full pelt onto the stage.  They'd seen the three figures fly high above  the backdrop set and were sure that this was the feared terrorist plot that had  been completely unimagined by the Cheese federations finest intelligence agents  and so was obviously going to happen.   They stared up in disbelief and a weary looking Trotsky approached them  in a far more casual manner.</p>
        <p>"Ah, stupid American Pig-dogski, didn't you knowski that  flying voz invwented by Rrrussian peasant in 1445."<br>
  "Yes, but he didn't do it bound and gagged like he was  spending an afternoon on deck 36!" piped up McAfee as she joined her crewmates  on the main stage.  At that precise  moment a commotion could be heard coming from the rear of the Meldrew Suite, as  the room invaded by a sea of delegates from the Cross Stitch Confederacy, many  still in their cabaret outfits, snorkels and bicycle clips, which if Trotsky  had had time to point out, were invented by Rrrussian peasant in 1173 and 1364  respectively.  The massed screams that  filled the air were merely a pre-cursor as Brian did his level best to try and  keep the <i>Frazer's</i> nose up as it crashed through the main sound stage,  decapitating half of the Leeds Women's Voluntary Service in one fell  swoop.  The huge bulk of rampaging metal  (read: cardboard and plywood) crashed through the gala arena of the Welwyn  Garden City Ringway Holiday Inn, splintering wood from the set was sent flying  in all directions as the hotel's manager came bursting in, nostrils and  moustache flaring.  <br>
  "BLOODY GERMANS! MANUEL!!!!!"<br>
  "Qué??"<br>
          The entirety of the <i>Frazer's</i> bridge crew stared on in  disbelief as their ship slowly ground to a halt three quarters of the way down  the central aisle of the auditorium.   Steam rose slowly from the battered front end of the wrecked saucer  (someone had spilt the tea) as they exclaimed in one voice <br>
  <font size="+3">"I  DON'T BELIEVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"</font></p>

        <p>Captain Rogers  gently stroked the new tacky sixties plastic pseudo-imitation leather effect  chair that took centre stage on the bridge.   He lifted a finger and inspected it thoroughly.  Part of him was slightly disappointed not to  find a layer of dust.  <br>
  "Mr George,  are we ready?"<br>
  "That depends,  Captain.  What did you have in mind?"<br>
  "You can be  sure-ski it inwolves deck 36-ski, and prwobably your-ski entire vation of  moustache wax-ski, (a quaint Rrrussian inwention which dates back-ski to  1630)."<br>
  "You mean it  was invented at half past four?"<br>
  "Cretin-ski".<br>
          The <i>Frazer's</i> engines flared.  This was because the  large red button on the helmsman's console was hit hard by George's forehead,  as he was sent reeling from the impact of the cricket bat as it swung into the  back of his skull.<br>
  "If you've  quite finished with your chit-chat, we do actually have a mission to carry  out.  Trotski, what kind of TWANG factor  can we achieve without the scaffolding falling off?"<br>
  "It all  depends-skiwhat grade of super-glue-ski voz used by ze stupid-ski pig-dog-ski  American special-effect-ski bod-ski".<br>
          <br>
          Outside, in  the dark gulf of space (also known as the broom cupboard in QVC studio 3) Ball  was busy doing an impersonation of the opening credits of Red Dwarf.  The only distinction being that even the  Cheese Federation wasn't foolish enough to paint their starships in red. <br>
  "Smoke me a  kipper, I'll be back for breakfast!"</p>
        <p>&lt;"It's Cold Outside, there's no kind of…&gt;</p>

        <p>Tad Des-Parot  (the show's director) charged onto the soundstage and managed to decapitate  Buzz Loudly (the chief sound editor) with one snap of his clapper boards.<br>
  "Next one that  tries that is gonna be singing soprano!"</p>
        <p>&lt;Cue: Tacky Sixties Music&gt;</p>
        <p>It's not often  that Doctor Doug was speechless.  But  being caught by your captain (a painful concept) with your trousers round your  ankles in a compromising position involving your chief nurse (Gladys  Emmanuelle, of course) and being up to your knees in a vat of cold porridge, in  the middle of sick bay, does tend to cramp your style.  And your patients who are trying to get some  sleep.  <br>
  "Ah, Doctor,  still conducting the radioactive Ready-Brek experiments, I see?  You really should try the sushi in the galley  B I hear Ensign Trotski particularly recommends it to us Western  pig-dogs-skis."<br>

          <p>&lt;Voice from  the Sidelines:- "Well, actually there's another reason you're in sick bay and  not the briefing room.  We haven't  actually built a briefing room yet.  We  used all the wood on the actors!"</p>
          <p>"Well  really!  That's act-<i>ors</i>!  I've not been so insulted since the time I  was understudying for Derek Jacobi when he implied that I hadn't paid for my  subscription of  <i>The Globe Periodical</i>!

          <p>There was a  stunned silence, as fear gripped the bridge crew, and Brian wet himself.  Unfortunately, not even Tribbles know which  way up a Tribble is, which made it very uncomfortable for Brian when he  realised he was doing a headstand on wet leather.<br>
            "Ohgodohgodwe'reallgonnadie!!" <br>
            Rogers was  like a blur.  He pulled his phase pistol  from it's hip holster, and fired in a split second.  The air fizzed as the laser blast made it's  mark, cutting straight through the target's skull and leaving a scorched  blackened mark on the bulkhead behind.<br>

          <p>"What our  esteemed commanding officer is trying to say", said Ball from the other end of  the table, "is that it's a big blank area of space, that happens to have been  placed at the centre of every single edition of the Cheese federation Road  Atlas.  It's in that bit of the Atlas  that no-one can ever quite see because it's just too near the centre.  No-one has ever successfully charted it,  because there's no decent map of exactly where it starts.  If you get too near, you never escape.   There are rumours and legends about The  Fold.  Some say it's a gateway to another  dimension even more baffling than this one.   Some say there's a gravity well leading to a black hole.  Some say any object will be torn to shreds by  a techno-babylon field which swirls around the area.  Some say it contains an enormous cloud of  molten liquorice.  Although those who say  that tend to be a bit stoned when they say it. Or it might be like what they  found within The Great Barrier in <i>The Final </i>Frontier, only not quite as  naff.  Or it might be empty.  A bit like Basildon".<br>
            "We are so  screwed." (thought Writer Number One's chocolate digestive as it dived  head-long into a steaming cup of coffee in a last ditch suicide attempt.  No, really, it did!)<br>
            "The Cheese  Federation is on the brink of a revolutionary next generation of road atlas B  the next edition will have those curly spiral back binding, instead of a glued  spine, so the area in the middle can no longer be uncharted.  That, apparently, is where we come in."</p>

          <p>The <i>Frazer</i> was rocked by laser blast after laser blast.   Luckily, they were 1970s BBC effects and therefore couldn't even damage  the crappy QVC sets.  The bridge crew  stared at the viewscreen, an immense array of varied space craft of every shape  and colour imaginable was lined up in front of them like a mass fleet preparing  for a Waterloo-style naval engagement.</p>
          <p>&lt;Voice from  the sidelines:- "STOP!!!! WE CAN'T AFFORD ANY MORE BLOODY MUSIC ROYALTIES!!!!  LEAST OF ALL TO BLOODY ABBA!!!&gt;</p>
          <p>The lead ship  had three pointy fork-like protrusions, with a torch on the end of each one,  and a large luminous green bum.  <br>
            On the <i>Frazer's </i> bridge, an area of air in front of  the viewscreen began to shimmer and a very strange loud pseudo-electronic style  noise could be not heard by everybody.   Suddenly three men and two women stood fondling bracelets and very  pointy torches, which is a shame because while they wasted time fondling their  weaponry and trying to look cool, Rogers shot the lot of them. <br>

          <p>Rogers had a  glint in his eye like never before.   Those new contact lenses were great! He dreamed of this moment.  At last, he was in a fight he could win, and  Ball was not his opponent!  The <i>Frazer</i> banked starboard, and took up a strafing on the ramshackle fleet's right  flank.  The first salvo blew the  scaffolding clear of the front of the hull. A putlug struck an <i>Eagle</i> head on, smashing straight through the viewscreen, decapitating both  pilots.  It didn't do enough damage to  cause an explosion but the <i>Eagle</i> blew up anyway, for no apparent reason.  The Cylon Base-Ships didn't stand a chance,  although they weren't made by the BBC effects team, the models were only three  inches high. One well-placed scaffold clip took out an entire fleet of three of  the monstrous Cylon craft and then everyone stopped and watched the stock  footage of a viper needing three laser blasts to not hit it's target but blow  it up anyway.  </p>
          <p>"Erm, what the  hell is actually happening here anyway?" enquired a spell-bound Ball.<br>
            Rogers was  completely entranced by the ensuing mayhem, and oblivious to all going on  around him.  <br>
            "It seems that  the contents of The Fold is actually every single spaceship in the history of  film and TV and film that has ever been destroyed, and they seem to be a little  bit annoyed.  It's possible they may want  to take hideous revenge and follow us back out of the Fold and invade our  Galaxy" offered McAfee by way of an extremely contrived explanation.  After a sharp glare from a beetroot coloured  Max Savings she added <br>
            "But only if  we need to turn this into a two-parter".<br>
            "And we're  doing what precisely?  Blowing them up  again?! That'll really help to cheer them up!" replied Ball.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile,  outside, the affray continued apace. A squadron of X-Wing fighters found a  convenient corridor running across the <i>Frazer's</i> saucer-section outer  hull and attempted to run along it's length to drop doughnuts into a garbage  outlet at one end, but were thwarted when they ran head long into a banner that  had been hung up outside proclaiming "DOCTOR DOUG - FORTY TODAY!" that had been  there for three weeks and which no-one had bothered to take down.  Meanwhile a marauding TIE fighter was equally  done in by a novelty Flag of St George stuck to the hull, which had been there  since England had lost their World Cup warm-up match against the Isle of Wight  the previous April.  The <i>Frazer</i> continued it's onslaught although ships from Ming the Merciless' evil forces of  Mongo showed stiff resistance with the use of a viciously waved sparkler.  A Dalek hub-cap saucer flew Frisbee-style  across the scene, missed the <i>Frazer</i> by several dozen light years, and  nearly decapitated poor Buzz Loudly, (if it wasn't for the fact his head was  still missing after the incident with the clapper board, it would have sliced  clean through his neck) while a swarm of Space-bourne spangly Dapol Daleks  charged hell for leather at the ship - and began to bounce harmlessly off the  front of the saucer section.   <br>
          A huge  shadow---</p>
        <p>&lt;Voice from  the Sidelines B Writer Number Two: ANOOOOO!!!!! JMS will never let us use  them!"</p>
        <p>A huge black  shape engulfed the <i>Frazer</i>, darkening the bridge. Quite why it should  have affected the lights was a mystery. <br>
  "This is the  Vogon Constructor Fleet.  This Fold has  been cited for development by the Cheese Federation to make a hyperspace  bypass, and accompanying Little Chefs.   Planning notices have been available in Admiral Camonbert's filing  cabinet since lunchtime last Tuesday".</p>
        <p>Four points of  light flashed in the distance but rest assured the <i>Frazer</i> managed to  destroy Buck Rogers before he could escape, a point of principle for the  Captain who thought there was only room for one Rogers in the Galaxy.  Mind you, that didn't stop him having plans  for Wilma Deering on Deck 36. </p>
        <p>The <i>Frazer's</i> tractor beam (a toe-rope with a sink plunger on one end) grasped her ship and  the <i>Frazer</i> fled the scene to let the Vogons do their worst.</p>
        <p>"CUT!!!" <br>
          The entirety  of QVC's back-stage staff were huddled round a painfully white, frigid lifeless  looking Max Savings, who was spread-eagled on the floor, one foot nervously  twitched showing the only sign that life still remained in his otherwise inert  form.<br>
          Tad Des-Parot  ran up to the huddled masses who were fanning Max Savings face to try and get  some air into his lifeless frame.<br>
  "Oh god! I  went too far!  I should have known, his  heart couldn't take it!  What was I  thinking?  All those effects, all the  cost!  I should've known it would have  been the end for him!"<br>
  "It wasn't  that" said George from his place on the bridge set.  "it was the Vogon poetry!!!!!!!!!"</p>
