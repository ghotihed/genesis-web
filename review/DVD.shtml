      <DIV CLASS="textboxshrunken" ID="starTrekTNGSeason3"> 
        <P>If you were paying attention last month, you will know that my DVD
          viewing recently has consisted of the third season the first of the
          &quot;modern&#39; Star Trek spin-offs, (and if you weren&#39;t I hope it was
          because you were watching First men In The Moon!) although it is a bit starling
          that the first season of this series is now almost as old as the Original
          Series was when the third season was being shown for the first time.</P>
        <P>Season three TNG was, as I said previously, where this series really
          got going. Having said that, and this is going to be mildly controversial,. My
          viewings of the first two seasons on DVD revealed that actually, they
          weren&#39;t quite as bad as is often made out, which in the case of season two
          is quite a starling claim, I know (I can see the headline now: &mdash;TNG SEASON
          TWO IN &quot;IT&#39;S NOT ACTUALLY THAT BAD&#39; SHOCK!&quot;). But honestly,
          they weren&#39;t. Now in season three, the TNG bandwagon really gathered
          pace.</P>
        <P>The third season was notable for the return of Doctor Beverley
          Crusher, after a year away at Starfleet Medical when she had been replaced by
          Data-hating, cranky McCoy clone Katherine Pulaski. The theory that Crusher was
          brought back because the crew were refusing to go anywhere near sickbay, even
          when they had shattered every appendage in their body while kayaking on the
          holodeck is merely a viscous rumour &mdash; probably. (Actually, like season two
          as a whole, she wasn&#39;t really that bad). Various character evolved from
          being slightly two dimensional previous seasons to develop much more in the
          course of the third season, especially Worf, Laforge, Wesley and surprisingly,
          Captain Picard, about whom there were concerns that he would stagnate as a
          character unless he got a bigger piece of the action as it were (no pun
          intended, and certainly no gangsters or machine guns).</P>
        <P>It was also very noticeable that throughout the season, it was the
          Romulans who were being built up as what in the Buffyverse would be termed
          &quot;The Big Bad&#39;. They were there in lots of episodes, a shadowy threat
          bubbling under the surface, but their rivalry with the Federation never quite
          igniting into a full scale conflict, although they came close on several
          occasions. I really enjoyed this aspect of season three, if only because the
          episodes they featured in were usually pretty good (especially The Enemy, a
          sort of loose, Trekified version of the film Ememy Mine) and The Defector, both
          of which featured the Romulan Commander Tomalok, played by the late Andreas
          Katsulas. At the same time, though, I found it frustrating because suddenly at
          the end of the series, the Romulan threat was kind of forgotten about and it
          was the Borg who re-appeared to provide the big end of season climax. Having
          said that, Admiral Hanson&#39;s throwaway line in The Best of Both Worlds
          about every available ship being mobilised against the Borg, the Klingons
          sending warships to help defend the Federation, and consideration even being
          given to opening dialogue with the Romulans about the Borg threat, does
          unintentionally put the threat from the Borg into perspective, given the
          on-going threat from the Romulans throughout the season. Probably unintentional
          but it does kind of make sense to interpret it this way. But it was still a
          little disappointing that the Romulan threat was never really fully explored
          again in the remaining seasons of TNG, with the exception of the two-part
          Unification a couple of seasons after.</P>
        <P>Another notable aspect of the third season is the episode The High
          Ground. When I watched this episode, it was the first time I&#39;d seen it,
          because this was the one that was banned by the BBC, and not shown in either of
          the series two BBC2 tea-time runs. The reason for the BBC ban was the subject
          this episode dealt with, terrorism, and one very specific line - in his study
          of terrorism, Data notes that Ireland was reunified in 2024 after a successful
          terrorist campaign. As a result, this episode was not originally shown on
          free-to-air television in the UK for many years. In the Republic of Ireland the
          episode was shown in full with an advisory that the content and allusions were
          fictional, and initial airings were edited when shown on satellite channel Sky
          One. The episode was broadcast unedited in May 2006 on Sky One and finally
          shown unedited on BBC2 during the third season&#39;s repeats after midnight in
          September 2007. I didn&#39;t have huge expectation for this episode because I
          had heard it was a bit clunky, even patronizing, in the same way as the
          previous season&#39;s episode which dealt with drug addiction. To be honest in
          paces it was clunky, and indeed a little patronizing, but actually, it
          wasn&#39;t as bad as some comments made out. Not the strongest episode of the
          season by any means, but in no way the worst either.</P>
        <P>Season three also saw the origins of the on-going saga of Lieutenant
          Worf&#39;s discommendation by the Klingon Empire, and through that, the
          various power struggles among the Klingon&#39;s ruling council. In the episode
          Sins of the Father Worf accepts discommendation in order to preserve the unity
          of the Empire, despite having proved that it was the father of Duras, not his
          own father, who betrayed the Klingons to the Romulans at Khitomer. This is a
          superb episode, which has ramifications for Worf and the federation for many
          seasons of TNG and DS9 to come.</P>
        <P>So which episodes are the stand-outs of season three? Well,
          there&#39;s quite a few. I won&#39;t go on about Yesterday&#39;s Enterprise
          again, because I did that last month, but I will repeat my opinion that it was
          with this episode was the one really brought the series to life. There are
          others which spring to mind. I&#39;ve already mentioned Sins of the Father,
          and a couple of episodes featuring the Romulans, but there are several others
          which have come to be highly rated or even considered classic episodes, or
          which have an influence in Star Trek films or episodes later on. Who Watches
          The Watchers? Deals with a &quot;Duck Blind&#39; mission, of the sort seen in
          the film Insurrection. Why do the Federation do these missions?</P>
        <P>They always seem to end badly! A Matter of Perspective is an
          excellent Whodunnit, which we saw at the club last summer if I remember
          rightly, and The Offspring is very often cited by cast, crew and fans as an all
          time favourite episode, as the nature of Data&#39;s purpose and existence is
          examined again with a new twist &mdash; Data builds his own child. Sarek
          features the return of the classic series character (Spock&#39;s father and a
          revered diplomat, in case you forgot), still brilliantly played by the late
          Mark Lenard. The razor-sharp Vulcan logic is present in the character despite
          the onset of a debilitating, incurable condition, as evidenced by his reply to
          Picard&#39;s claim that he saw the Ambassador shedding tears at a classical
          music concert. &quot;Your logic fails you Captain, I recall only one tear&quot;
          retorts Sarek. The Most Toys puts Data in the spotlight, and the collection of
          an obsessive collector who will go to extraordinary lengths to possess unique
          items. Data&#39;s nemesis is one of the most unpleasant characters ever
          portrayed in Star Trek and causes even Data&#39;s moral fibre to snap as he is
          snatched away by the Enterprise transporter. A fraction of a second later, and
          Data would have killed him. The third season was when the portrayal of the
          Ferengi started to change from a sinister alien force (which lets face it, they
          could never really live up to) into recurring comic relief, not least in Menage
          A Troi, which features a brilliant turn by Majel Barrett as Lwaxanna Troi, and
          some startling acting from Captain Picard! They also play a big part in
          Captain&#39;s Holiday, which is a cracking good romp for Picard, and which
          finally shattered the illusion that Picard was permanently stuck on the bridge
          or in the ready room, although they managed to preserve the rule that the
          captain doesn&#39;t get placed in the line of fire (much). Hollow Pursuits
          sees the introduction of Dwight Schultz as Lieutenant Reg Barclay. This is the
          episode for all of the fans who wished they had their own Holodeck, so they
          could hang out on Ten Forward, hit on Troi, and beat up Commander Riker. The
          newly introduced Lt Barclay does all of those things and more in this episode,
          which features the first appearance of the soon to be fan favourite character.
          This is a very entertaining episode, but it&#39;s the kind that crosses-over
          and is fun for fans and non-fans alike. And then there was the return of our
          old friend Q, in the episode Deja Q, which with a bit of luck we&#39;ll be
          viewing at the club today. One of the best Q episode without a doubt, I&#39;ll
          say no more than that.</P>
        <P>Finally, The Best of Both Worlds Part 1. The last episode of the
          season and the return in force of The Borg. A tour de force for Star Trek on
          TV, with all the elements that make for great science fiction and great Star
          trek, plus, a hell of a cliff-hanger, which writer Michael Piller wrote without
          a clue how to resolve! Yes, really &mdash; he was signed on for just one year,
          wrote the cliff hanger and assumed he would be leaving and that what happened
          after the immortal words &quot;Mister Worf.....fire!&quot; would be someone
          else&#39;s problem. It was therefore a good thing that he was persuaded to
          stay on by Rick Berman and Gene Roddenberry.</P>
        <P>So that was it for season three, I&#39;ll soon be looking at box
          set prices on Play.com no doubt, and at some point I will be diving headlong
          into the four memorable seasons which followed this landmark year.</P>

        Litefoot series 1 CD</A> - 17th October 2010</H2> 
      <DIV CLASS="textboxshrunken" ID="jagoAndLitefoot"> 
        <P>A few months ago, I promised to seek out a new and unheard of (at
          least to me) series or Sci-Fi item and do a review of it, in a bid to encourage
          everyone to explore new and fresh ideas about what&#39;s out there. This was a
          promise that I made after whinging about the lack of original ideas and the
          plethora of &quot;reimaginings&quot; that now dominate both the large and the
          small screen. So just what did I find you ask?</P>
        <P>Well, cast your mind back to the 1970&#39;s and Tom Baker&#39;s
          tenure as the Doctor. A story that many of you may know, and that is generally
          considered to be a classic, is titled the Talon&#39;s of Weng Chiyan. Now this
          is a story that I had not seen, prior to completing this
          &quot;experiment&#39;, but as I&#39;ve seen many a Doctor Who this obviously
          didn&#39;t qualify as a candidate for review. However there are two remarkable
          characters from this story. The first, Doctor George Litefoot is a Victorian
          gentleman and medical pathologist, who works with London&#39;s constabulary.
          He is thrown into partnership with Mr Henry Gordon Jago, a theatre impresario
          and entrepreneur extraordinaire. Together they aid the Doctor to vanquish a
          futuristic Asian time traveller with evil abomination in mind.</P>
        <P>Now these characters have been given the Big Finish treatment, and
          their resurrection, some 30 odd years since their original outing, was launched
          earlier this year as a box set entitled Jago and Litefoot Investigators of
          Infernal Incidents. A series of 4 stories set in the realm of the Victorian
          gentlemen and the paranormal investigations of the not so daring duo. This box
          set is perhaps optimistically labelled Series One.</P>
        <P>The stories revolve around the adventures of the pair as they find
          themselves inadvertently thrust into a series of situations. The nice bit about
          this is they don&#39;t go looking for them, but the trouble comes to them when
          interesting cadavers come across Doctor Litefoot&#39;s pathology table. These
          &quot;interesting cases&quot; have a habit of being discussed over appropriate
          beverages at the local tavern, and the cases have this nasty tendency to come
          back to bite them (sometimes literally).</P>
        <P>The beauty of this series is in the writing. It absolutely drips of
          Victorian England, and the casting of the original Actors (Christopher Benjamin
          and Trevor Baxter), seems to have enhanced the story telling no end, as the
          pair have picked up where they left off, as if they only starred in the
          Talon&#39;s of Weng Chiyan yesterday. This enjoyment oozes out of every
          sentence uttered, and the fun factor that must have filled the recording
          studio, comes over in wave after wave, as the pair stumble their way through
          story after story.</P>
        <P>This Big Finish production is a wonderful piece of work that fully
          deserves a heart felt recommendation to all, whether you&#39;ve seen their
          original Doctor story or not.</P>
        <P>I for one, am very pleased that I made the promise to look out for
          something new, otherwise this set of stories could so easily have passed me by.
          My world is definitely better knowing that Jago and Litefoot exist. May they go
          from strength to strength. Bring on series two!</P> </DIV><A
