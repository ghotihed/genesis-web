        <P>I&#39;m currently sitting here watching the first of the new series
          run of Primeval and my jaw is on the floor (actually, it&#39;s the last
          commercial break, so I&#39;ll be stopping in a minute as soon as the programme
          comes back!)</P> 
        <P>I never realised just how much I had missed this humdinger of a
          series. It&#39;s always been a brilliant excuse to leave your brain on the ...
          (Yep, you&#39;ve guessed it, the programme just came back for it&#39;s last
          bit).</P> 
        <P>WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWWW WWWWW!!!!</P> 
        <P>Where was I, oh yes. Leave your brain on the side board and just
          enjoy the mayhem, allowing the insanity to just wash over you in a glorious
          flood. We&#39;ve just put on The Making of Primeval, that was actually
          broadcast just prior to the main programme that we recorded just in case it has
          any spoilers in, and even that&#39;s really cool.</P> 
        <P>So what&#39;s it all about, well Professor Nick Cutter is a genius
          plagued continually by his psychotic &quot;ex&quot; wife. Your never really
          sure of her motivations or true intentions, you just know she&#39;s trouble
          with a capital T. Instead of stalking his girlfriends and shredding his
          clothes, she disrupts the Earths entire time stream and evolutionary processes
          just in order to mess with his head (well, I did say she was psychotic).</P> 
        <P>Cutter leads a rag tag bunch of amateurs that work to track down
          anomalies (event horizons that allow ancient creatures to cross over into
          modern day, to create havoc).</P> 
        <P>Abby is the reptile expert, Cutter may know all about ancient
          fossils and history, but Abby understands the way animals live and breathe.
          Connor is a complete idiot, an academic that stumbles into a world that he
          could never have imagined, and yet somehow becomes invaluable to the team, by
          his design of a mechanism for detecting and sealing these dangerous
          anomalies.</P> 
        <P>Steven is Cutter&#39;s right hand man, and the only really action
          man type of hero in the cast.</P> 
        <P>Lastly there&#39;s Claudia Brown, she soon becomes an intrinsic, if
          reluctant member of the team. Her job is that of providing cover stories for
          the bizarre events unfolding in the story, and to keep such things out of the
          public eye. She soon becomes Cutter&#39;s love interest and forms the basis of
          the cliff hanger ending to season one.</P> 
        <P>So where are we now? Wel l the information above details the team as
          they evolved in season one. I&#39;ve just finished watching the first part of
          season four.</P> 
        <P>By now, Cutter, Steven, Helen (Nick&#39;s ex) and Claudia are all
          dead or have moved on, and Conner and Abby have spent the last year trapped in
          the Cretaceous period. Confused, then you&#39;d better just get watching. Just
          remember where you left your brain!</P>
